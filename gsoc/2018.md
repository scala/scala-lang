## Google Summer of Code

**This year the Scala team applied again for the [Google Summer of
  Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)
  program to work with enthusiastic students on challenging Scala
  projects**

This page provides a list of project ideas. The suggestions are only a
starting point for students. We expect students to explore the ideas
in much more detail, preferably with their own suggestions and
detailed plans on how they want to proceed. Don't feel constrained by
the provided list! We welcome any of your own challenging ideas, but
make sure that the proposed project satisfies the [main
requirements](#requirements-and-guidelines) mentioned below.

### How to get involved

The best place to propose and discuss your proposals is our
["contributors"](http://contributors.scala-lang.org/)
discussion forum. This way you will get quickly responses from the whole
Scala community.

### Previous Summer of Code

We encourage you to have a look at our
[2017](http://scala-lang.org/gsoc/2017/),
[2016](http://scala-lang.org/gsoc/2016/),
[2015](http://scala-lang.org/gsoc/2015/),
[2014](http://scala-lang.org/gsoc/2014/),
[2013](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2013/03/20/gsoc13.html),
[2012](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc2012#),
[2011](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc2011#),
[Summer of Code 2010](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc2010#)
pages to get an idea on what we and you can expect while working on Scala.

## Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas. The list is non-binding and any reasonable
project related to Scala that is proposed by a student will be thoroughly
reviewed.

### Mill Build Tool

[Mill](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill) is a new Scala build tool, inspired by 
[CBT](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt) and [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), which 
aims to be a full substitute for Scala's venerable [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
Building upon the principles laid out [here](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html)
and [here](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html), 
Mill aims to be dramatically simpler than current build tools both inside and 
outside the Scala community while still preserving the rich functionality people
expect from a build tool.

This is a catch-all header for multiple possible Mill-related projects, whose
exact scope will be finalized closer to the GSOC date

### Scalafix in the editor

[Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) is a linting and refactoring tool, which
aims to help automate migration between different Scala compiler and library versions.
Currently, the primary way to interact with Scalafix is in batch mode through a command-line interface.
However, many users have requested the ability to use Scalafix interactively through an editor.

A [proof-of-concept integration](https://geirsson.com/assets/metals/) running Scalafix from VS Code 
through the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is already working.
Many popular IDE refactorings like "Move class" and "Organize imports" are missing, however.

The scope of this GSOC project would be to implement new Scalafix refactoring rules to be used from an editor.
The project can start small with simple refactorings, and gradually step up as progress happens.
Scalafix is a fast moving project, so you will be working in a codebase with multiple contributors.

### scalajs-bundler 1.0

[scalajs-bundler](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/) provides useful features
with a high level of configurability, making it easier for Scala.js developers to use
NPM packages. However, several important requests haven’t been fulfilled yet: moving the
parts that fetch NPM packages to a separate sbt plugin, making it possible to use scalajs-bundler
without sbt, documenting how to get a super productive development setup with fast
hot-reloading, etc. The GSOC project consists in tackling all scalajs-bundler remaining issues
for a 1.0 version.

### CBT support for Play Framework

Implement everything necessary to have a smooth development experience with [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) and [cbt](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt), e.g. restarting the server on change, bundling/minimizing js/css, integration with scalajs. Take guidance from sbt plugin.

Supervised by [@cvogt](https://github.com/cvogt).

### CBT Coursier integration

Allow using [coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier) as the resolver in [cbt](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt).

Supervised by [@cvogt](https://github.com/cvogt).

### CBT Ticket hunt

Bring down these open tickets for [cbt](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt) by picking some of the most urgent or interesting ones.

### Debugger integration for Scala Native

[Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/) is an optimizing ahead-of-time compiler for Scala.
It's implemented in Scala and generates optimized LLVM IR for the whole program.
In this project you're going add support for [LLVM source-level debugging information](https://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html)
to the compiler toolchain. This information is necessary to make external debuggers
such as [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org) and [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) work
with Scala Native applications.

### Windows support for Scala Native

[Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/) started as a \*nix-only toolchain.
A number of major APIs such as files, sockets and threads are implemented on top of POSIX APIs.
This poses major challenges in porting the toolchain to Windows. In this project you're
going to continue working on the Windows port of Scala Native based on [prior
work by @muxanick](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/691).

## Requirements and Guidelines

### General Student Application Requirements

This is the seventh time the Scala project has applied to the Summer of
Code, and from previous years’ experience, increased popularity of the
language and stories of other mentor organizations we expect a high
number of applications. First, be aware of the following:

*   Make sure that you understand, fulfill and agree to the general
    [Google Summer of Code rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/)
*   The work done during GSoC requires some discipline as
    you have to plan your day-to-day activity by
    yourself. Nevertheless, you can expect regular contact with your
    mentors both via the usual means of communication for you project
    as well as personal guidance via email, chat or phone. The mentor is
    there for you in case you get stuck or need some guidance during your 3 month coding project.
*   The [official SoC timetable](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)
    mentions May 14 as the official start of coding. If you
    have time, you are encouraged to research your proposals even
    before that (and definitely learn the basics of Scala, if you
    haven't done that already).

### Student Application Guidelines

*   Student proposals should be very specific. We want to see evidence
    that you can succeed in the project. Applications with one-liners
    and general descriptions definitely won't make the cut.
*   Because of the nature of our projects students must have some
    knowledge of the Scala language. Applicants with Scala programming
    experience will be preferred. Alternatively, experience with
    functional programming could suffice, but in your application we
    want to see evidence that you can quickly be productive in Scala.
*   You can think of Google Summer of Code as a kind of independent
    internship. Therefore, we expect you to work full-time during the
    duration. Applicants with other time commitments are unlikely to
    be selected. From our previous experience we know that students'
    finishing their studies (either Bachelor, Master of PhD) are
    likely to be overwhelmed by their final work, so please don't be
    too optimistic and carefully plan your time for the project.
*   If you are unsure whether your proposal is suitable, feel free to
    discuss it on our
    ["contributors"](http://contributors.scala-lang.org/)
    discussion forum. We have many community members on our mailing list
    who will quickly answer any of your questions regarding the
    project. Mentors are also constantly monitoring the mailing
    list. Don't be afraid to ask questions. We’d love to help you out!

### General Proposal Requirements

The proposal will be submitted via the standard web-interface at
[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/),
therefore plain text is the best way to go. We expect your application
to be in the range of 700-1500 words. Anything less than that will
probably not contain enough information for us to determine whether
or not you are the right person for the job.

Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but
feel free to include anything that you think is relevant:

*   Please include your name (weird as it may be, people do forget it)
*   Title of your proposal
*   Abstract of your proposal
*   Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why it
    is innovative (maybe you already have a prototype?), what
    contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why
    do you think your project is needed. A rough plan of your
    development and possible architecture sketches.
*   Description of previous work, existing solutions (links to
    prototypes or references are more than welcome!)
*   Write us about yourself and convince that you are the right
    person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not
    sufficient)
    *   Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous
        work, internships
    *   Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal
        (programming languages, frameworks)?
    *   Any previous open-source projects (or even previous GSoC) you
        have contributed to?
    *   Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may
        affect you work? Any vacations/holidays planned? Please be
        specific as much as you can.
*   If you apply to more than one GSoC project, especially if you also apply
    for a project in another organization, specify which project you prefer.
    In case two organizations choose to accept your applications,
    we can then give you the project that is most important to you.
    Preferring the project of another organization will *not* influence our
    decision whether to accept your application.
*   Contact details (**very important!**)
