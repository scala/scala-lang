Tickets in the Scala bug tracker [marked with "community" label](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20%22community%22%20and%20status%20%3D%20open%20ORDER%20BY%20createdDate%20desc)
are ripe for the picking! Thanks to everyone who has [pitched in already](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20%22community%22%20and%20resolution%20%3D%20fixed%20ORDER%20BY%20createdDate%20desc).

Don't feel limited or compelled in your selection by this label, it is just intended as a starting
point. All tickets are fair game!

As outlined in the [contributing guide](./guide.html), it is prudent to share your plans to work
on tickets with us on [scala-internals](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-internals),
especially for non-trivial changes. That way you can get advice about how to attack the problem.
