## Code Review Contributions

In addition to [bug fixing](/contribute/guide/), you can help us review 
[waiting pull requests](#pull-requests-awaiting-comment). 
This is also a good (and recommended) way to get to know the feel of
the bug-fixing and submissions process before jumping in with your
own pull requests.

 
### Review Guidelines

[Code of Conduct reminder](/conduct/)

* Keep comments on-topic, concise and precise.
* Attach comments to particular lines or regions they pertain to whenever possible.
* Short code examples are often more descriptive than prose.
* If you have thoroughly reviewed the PR and thought through all angles, LGTM (Looks Good To Me) is the preferred acceptance response.
* Additional reviews should try to offer additional insights: "I also thought about it from this angle and it still looks good.."
* Above all, remember that the people you are reviewing might be reviewing your PRs one day too.
* If you are receiving the review, consider that the advice is being given to make you, and Scala, better rather than as a negative critique. Assume the best, rather than the worst.
