title: "Catch bugs with Scalafix v0.5"
date: 11-9-2017

I am excited to announce the release of [Scalafix v0.5.0-RC3][].
This release introduces new features in addition to several bug fixes and
integration improvements.

If you are not familiar with Scalafix, Scalafix is a rewrite and linting tool
for Scala.
The project is developed at the [Scala Center][sc] with the mission to help
automate migration between different Scala compiler and library versions.

## Linting

Scalafix v0.5 supports linters.
Linters are programs that analyze source code for usages of language constructs that could unwittingly lead to bugs, and emit warnings when these potential issues are found.
Linters are particularly useful for defining and enforcing coding standards across teams.

Before v0.5, Scalafix rules could only provide rewrite instructions to "fix" code.
Now, it's possible to implement Scalafix rules that only report messages instead
of rewrite instructions.
Each category of lint messages is attached to a default severity level
(info/warn/error), which users can override via configuration.

The first Scalafix linter is [`NoInfer`][].
`NoInfer` reports errors when the Scala compiler infers one of the following types:
`Any`, `AnyVal`, `Product` or `Serializable`.
It's usually a bad sign when the compiler infers such a generic type.
In those cases, it's better to explicitly type annotate the expected type.


### Building a custom linter
It's simple to implement custom Scalafix linters.
To demonstrate this, let's implement a `FinalCaseClass` linter that reports an error if
a case class is not marked as final.
We start our project with the scalacenter/scalafix.g8 template.

```sh
sbt new scalacenter/scalafix.g8 --rule="FinalCaseClass" --version="v1.0"
cd scalafix
sbt tests/test
```

Rules are implemented with Scalafix and Scalameta.

```scala
// rules/src/main/scala/fix/FinalCaseClass_v1.scala
package fix
import scalafix._
import scala.meta._, contrib._

case object FinalCaseClass extends Rule("FinalCaseClass") {
  val error = LintCategory.error(
    "Extending a case classes can have surprising equals/hashCode behavior."
  )
  override def check(ctx: RuleCtx): List[LintMessage] = ctx.tree.collect {
    case cls: Defn.Class if cls.hasMod(mod"case") && !cls.hasMod(mod"final") =>
      error.at(s"case class $name must be final", cls.name.pos)
  }
}
```
When `FinalCaseClass` encounters a non-final case class it reports a message like this

```scala
scala/test/FinalCaseClass.scala:8: error: [FinalCaseClass] case class Foo must be final
  case class Foo(a: Int)
             ^
```

We can use scalafix-testkit to make sure our rewrite works as expected.
The top of the file contains a comment including configuration about
which rule to run.

```scala
/*
rule = "class:fix.FinalCaseClass"
*/
class FinalCaseClass {
  case class Foo(a: Int) // assert: FinalCaseClass
  final case class Bar(a: Int)
}
```

The `// assert: FinalCaseClass` comment asserts that a linter message with id "FinalCaseClass" is reported
on line 7.
The test fails if

- a message is not reported on that line
- a message is reported on that line but the category id doesn't match,
- a message is reported at a line without an assert

`FinalCaseClass` is ready for a release!
It is not necessary to fiddle with cross-building or publishing to Maven Central,
Scalafix can run custom rules from source.
Our friends can try out `FinalCaseClass` by installing [sbt-scalafix][]
and execute from the sbt shell

```
sbt> scalafix github:olafurpg/FinalCaseClass/v1
```

The full source code for `FinalCaseClass` is available in [olafurpg/FinalCaseClass][].
To learn more about implementing custom rules, refer to our
[documentation](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/#Creatingyourownrule).

> Note. Scalafix has not at all shifted away its focus from rewriting.
> The idea to use Scalafix for linting initially started as a discussion in
> [Scala Contributors][].
> It turned out to be simple to add basic linting capabilities with the
> existing Scalafix infrastructure.

## sbtfix

Another notable new feature in Scalafix v0.5 is the ability to rewrite sbt build
sources with access to the semantic API.
The first available sbt rewrite is [`Sbt1`][], which migrates several deprecated
sbt "fishy operators" such as `<++=` to the recommended `.value` DSL.
To run `Sbt1` on your 0.13 build, follow the installation instructions for
the [sbt-scalafix][] plugin and execute `> sbtfix Sbt1`.

Custom sbtfix rules are implemented just like regular Scalafix rules.
No custom setup is required from rule authors to fix sbt source files.
The semantic API to resolve names and symbols signatures is supported, but
advanced sections such as `Synthetics` (which `NoInfer` use) are not.
I am excited to see what the community can build with this new functionality.
Some ideas that come to my mind include

- update library dependency versions
- install new library dependencies
- automatically enforce sbt best-practices

To learn more about how Scalafix supports semantic analysis of sbt 0.13 and
Scala 2.10 sources, see [semanticdb-sbt][].

> Note.
> Semantic API support for *.sbt files is still only at a "proof-of-concept"
> stage. The current implementation requires more engineering work to reach
> the same level of coverage as the semantic API for 2.11/2.12 *.scala source
> files.

## Tab completion

Scalafix v0.5 improves the sbt-scalafix plugin and scalafix-cli in many ways.
Most of these bug fixes and improvements involve fairly boring
behind-the-scenes mechanics.
However, I believe one small quality-of-life improvement is worth highlighting:
*tab completion of Scalafix rules*.

![Scalafix tab completion]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/img/scalafix-tab-completion.gif)

Tab completion is supported in sbt-scalafix as well as for scalafix-cli in
bash and zsh.
Tab completion makes it easier to discover which rewrites are available and
help prevents typos when spelling out rewrite names.
To install completions for scalafix-cli, follow the instructions in `--help`.

## What's next

I believe we will soon reach a tipping point for Scala tooling.
Semantic analysis of Scala programs has traditionally been tricky business,
requiring intimate familiarity with compiler internals.
Scalameta and Scalafix involve none of that.
For example, the core logic of the `NoInfer` rule is implemented in
[10 lines][NoInfer] of fairly straightforward, immutable and functional code.

Next steps for Scalafix include:

* more comprehensive understanding of "synthetics" such as inferred implicit
  arguments, [#266][]. This is important for Dotty migration rewrites.
* more linting rules. I would love to unite efforts with Scalastyle and
  Wartremover to offer an extensive set of linting rules in a single tool.
  Scalafix can definitely benefit from their experience in this space.
* more complete `Sbt1` rewrite to accellerate sbt 1.0 migration, see
  [sbtfix issues][].
* more polished integrations. Currently, running Scalafix in a large project
  typically results in many spurious errors and warnings.

I encourage everyone to get involved if they want to improve the state of Scala tooling.
