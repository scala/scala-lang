title: "Scala Workshop (Scala2013) Student Talks to be Awarded Full ECOOP Registration!"
---

Thanks to a generous donation from Typesafe and Oracle Labs, we will be awarding a limited number of accepted student talks with full ECOOP registration (a value of 350EUR). Student talks are designed to be 5-10 minutes in duration, presenting ongoing or completed research related to Scala, or announcing a project that would be of interest to the Scala community. To be considered, simply submit a title and abstract by April 12th (students may update/change title/abstract until the final April 19th deadline) at the [Scala2013 website](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2013/). In addition to student talks, we solicit full research papers, short research papers, and tool demos.
