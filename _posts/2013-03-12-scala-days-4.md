---

The fourth annual [Scala Days](http://scaladays.org/) will be held this year at The Hudson Theater in NYC, June 10th-12th. Now is the time to submit speaking sessions and register to attend!

Scala Days 2013 aims to bring together developers from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala and Scala-based libraries and frameworks. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for Scala users to interact with contributors to the language and related technologies. Martin Odersky  will give this year’s keynote, and featured speakers include Jonas Bonér, Viktor Klang and others.

The call for papers will stay open until Monday, April 15th; however, we will announce accepted talks on a rolling basis, so get your proposals in quickly! We are aiming to host a series of Technical Talks, Reports of Real World Applications and Tools Demonstrations. The Scala Days committee also looks for creative ideas from you, so submit any topics you think the community would find exciting, inspiring, thought provoking and interesting! 

Please prepare an abstract of your talk (less than 1000 characters), and submit it to [info@scaladays.org](mailto:info@scaladays.org)
