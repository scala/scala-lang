**This year the Scala team applied again for
[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014),
and we're happy to announce that we have been approved to be mentoring organization!**

### What is Google Summer of Code

Google invites students to come up with interesting, non-trivial problems for
their favourite open-source projects and work on them over the summer.
Participants get support from the community, plus a mentor who makes sure they
don't get lost and that students meet their goals. Aside from the satisfaction
of solving challenging problems, students get paid for their work. This is an
incredible opportunity to get involved in the Scala community and get helpful
support along the way.

### How to get involved

First, have a look at our [project ideas page][gsoc2014]. The ideas there are
meant as suggestions to serve as a starting point. We expect students to
explore the ideas in much more detail, preferably with their own suggestions
and detailed plans on how they want to proceed. But don't feel constrained by
the provided list! We welcome any challenging project idea pertaining to
Scala!

The best place to propose and discuss your proposals is our
["scala-language"](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language) mailing list. This
way you will get quickly responses from the whole Scala community. If you know
of a potential mentor, it also might be a good idea to also include them in
your discussion on the scala-language mailing list. If not, don't be afraid to
ask who you might be able to contact in your discussion on scala-language.

### Previous Summer of Code

We encourage you to have a look at our [Summer of Code 2010][gsoc2010],
[2011][gsoc2011], [2012][gsoc2012] and [2013][gsoc2013] pages to get an idea
of kind of projects we undertook in previous years.

Please join us!
