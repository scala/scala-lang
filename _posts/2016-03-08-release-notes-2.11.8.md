We are pleased to announce the availability of Scala 2.11.8!

Significant changes since 2.11.7 include:

* The Scala REPL now has robust and flexible tab-completion (details below)
* An assortment of bugs have been fixed

Compared to 2.11.7, this release resolves [44 issues](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SI%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%22Scala%202.11.8%22%29%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC).  We merged [175 pull requests](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+milestone%3A2.11.8).

As usual for minor releases, Scala 2.11.8 is binary compatible with other releases in the Scala 2.11 series.

The last planned 2.11.x release will be 2.11.9 in late 2016.

### New tab-completion in the Scala REPL

The implementation of tab-completion in the Scala REPL has been rewritten and now uses the same infrastructure as for example Scala IDE and ENSIME.

There are a number of improvements:

* Reliable completion, also in partial expressions and syntactically incorrect programs: try `class C { def f(l: List[Int]) = l.<TAB>`
* CamelCase completion: try `(l: List[Int]).rro<TAB>`, it expands to `(l: List[Int]).reduceRightOption`
* Show desugarings performed by the compiler by adding `//print`: try `for (x <- 1 to 10) println(x) //print<TAB>`
* Complete bean getters without typing `get`: try `(d: java.util.Date).day<TAB>`
* Find members by typing any CamelCased part of the name: try `classOf[String].typ<TAB>` to get `getAnnotationsByType`, `getComponentType` and others
* Complete non-qualified names, including types: try `def f(s: Str<TAB>`
* Press tab twice to see the method signature: try `List(1,2,3).part<TAB>`, which completes to `List(1,2,3).partition`; press tab again to display `def partition(p: Int => Boolean): (List[Int], List[Int])`

Thanks to @retronym and @som-snytt for their fruitful collaboration on this work!
