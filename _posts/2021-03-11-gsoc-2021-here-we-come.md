We are delighted to announce: the Scala Center has been accepted as a mentor
organization for this yearâ€™s Google Summer of Code!

We have 19 days to attract as many motivated students as possible! We gathered
19 mentors that proposed 28 projects, plenty to choose from.

Please spread the word, engage with your networks and let students
[apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5449337515016192/).


One of the Scala Center's biggest goals is to make the Scala community more
diverse and inclusive of groups that are underrepresented in tech. Google
Summer of Code is a great opportunity for us to engage with students around the
world and onboard a new, more diverse generation of contributors to Scala and
its ecosystem.


Scala has been a part of Google Summer of Code since 2010. With 65 projects &
students, ~70 mentors over the years, many of whom continued contributing to
Scala, we are happy to announce that in 2021 the Scala Center will reignite the
collaboration and commit to providing an awesome experience going forward.

These are especially exciting times: Scala 3-RC1 has been released mid-February
2021, after 8 years of development. We invite you to choose your project and
enjoy the fresh new approach!


If you are an eligible student and are interested in participing in Scala's
Google Summer of Code 2021, you can begin discussing project ideas with our
mentors.  Then you have from March 29 to April 13 to submit your draft
proposals through [the program website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5449337515016192/).

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
