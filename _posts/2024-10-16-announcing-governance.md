title: "Scala: a mature open-source project"
by: Scala Core Team
---

In over twenty years of developing Scala, we’ve learned that good project governance is the key to the maturity, resilience, and health of any open-source project, even more so for a project of the size and complexity of Scala. We learned that governance is iterative and ever-evolving, to follow the project’s development needs and adjust to them. We also learned that transparency is very important to build trust and stability. These are the guiding principles for the Scala teams at LAMP, Lightbend, Scala Center, and VirtusLab, [the organisations that drive Scala development](/governance/#whos-behind-scala).

## The journey so far

We started working on the Scala governance redesign in the wake of the [Scala 3 release](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html) in May 2021\.

The vast landscape of Scala governance was mapped out and presented in a [keynote at ScalaCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svWnwU5PXxE) by Darja Jovanovic and Adam Goodman. It includes areas like development and  release coordination, community management, knowledge transfer, SIP, IT security, Scala Tooling and more. We are proud of the great progress achieved on these fronts in the last three years, and we will continue to grow and evolve these efforts further.

In 2022 we also announced the first major milestone, the updated [Scala Improvement Process](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/07/13/scala-improvement-process-reloaded.html) to openly and collaboratively evolve the Scala language by accepting and evaluating formal proposals.

In 2023 we held two Tooling Summits to consolidate the tooling ecosystem and ensure a better user experience across the board, as described in the [Lausanne gathering](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2023/04/11/march-2023-scala-tooling-summit.html) from March ’23.

And today we are proud and delighted to announce the following additions: 

* [Updated governance structure and processes](/governance)  
  outlines the organisation and decision-making bodies, as well as individuals and organisations working on Scala language releases and development, and

* [Scala development guiding policies and guarantees](/development)  
  gives a detailed overview about the key policies, best practices, and guarantees that guide Scala development, ensuring consistency, reliability, and maintainability. 

If you are interested in going deeper in these topics, we invite you to read the pages mentioned above.

If you are wondering how these matters impact your daily life as a Scala programmer or a company who uses Scala, keep reading this blog post.

## 5 key improvements every Scala user will benefit from

### Product-driven decision making process

One of the most significant updates was the paradigm shift from treating Scala 3 as an open-source project to approaching it as an open-source product. Scala 3 is developed with predictable release cycles, issue reports are consistently prioritised and added to a milestone, and the roadmap for new features and improvements is well-defined. This focus on product success is fully reflected in the governance model and structure, led by the Product Manager, Piotr Chabelski from the Scala team at VirtusLab. This approach was inspired by the Scala 2 era and its ongoing success.

### Well defined Scala distributions

Scala 3.x releases are always backward compatible, but not the opposite to allow evolving and improving the language. This creates a complex challenge of aligning the library ecosystem on a baseline version, which was resolved with introducing two parallel distributions, as designed by Paweł Marks from the Scala team at VirtusLab:

* Scala Next is the default line that is actively developed by the compiler team, and is the preferred target version for all non-library projects.   
* Scala LTS (long term support) is the preferred target version for libraries.

This is explained further in [Scala development guarantees](/development).

As before, Scala 2 has stable 2.13 and 2.12 distributions.

### Predictable and frequent releases

The new governance model and structure improved the coordination between different teams working on Scala development and releases. We have been testing the model since February 2024 and we are confident that technical decisions around Scala releases and distributions are now synchronised and running smoothly. As a result, Scala 3 users experience [predictable, well-managed releases](/development/#schedule-iterations-and-roadmap), typically at six to twelve week intervals.

### Standardised backlog management on the Scala repo

One big hurdle in the Scala 3 journey was the backlog of issues on the Scala repo. Users and contributors were reporting bugs, but there were more open issues than the team could manage. Now, a clear and efficient process is in place to triage, validate, and label issues within a week of their submission.

### Easier access to Scala maintainers

You can now find lists of Scala maintainers and their roles on the new [Governance page](/governance). We invite Scala users and contributors to tag maintainers on Scala related issues, according to their expertise and role, to further help responsiveness. Also, we encourage everyone to follow and engage with maintainers on official [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/scala/scala3/discussions), [Users](https://users.scala-lang.org/) and [Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/) forums, [Discord chat rooms](https://discord.com/invite/scala).

### Conclusion

Following the major Scala 3 release in May 2021, the Scala teams faced many challenges. To name a few: Would Scala 3 succeed? How would the ecosystem migrate, and how long would it take? Who would provide and coordinate the resources necessary to operate and advance this big project? At the time of the release, the pool of Scala 3 experts was quite small and existing governance was not adapted to absorb the big change. With significant engineering and time commitment, financial investment and expertise from companies backing Scala, incredible support from the community contributors, and various community driven Scala organisations, we have overcome these challenges and delivered a stable and reliable Scala project.

## Acknowledgements

We have the pleasure to recognise those organisations and individuals who have significantly contributed to bringing the Scala project to this stage.

To each and every person who worked at the **Programming Methods Laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne** (or: LAMP at EPFL) for their extraordinary contributions to the world of programming through Scala, and especially to:

* **Martin Odersky**, Scala language designer, from creating the language to continuously inventing and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, Martin’s vision and dedication have shaped not just Scala, but modern programming itself. His commitment to driving innovation has had an immeasurable impact on both the community and the future of software development.   
* **Fabien Salvi**, System Admin, for patiently and diligently taking care of both the Scala infrastructure and for his technical assistance to each person that has ever worked in Martin’s lab and Scala Center over the last twenty years.  
* **Nicolas Stucki**, Compiler Engineer, for his outstanding work on metaprogramming in Scala 3, his contributions in the Scala governance project, and mentoring on the Scala 3 compiler.
