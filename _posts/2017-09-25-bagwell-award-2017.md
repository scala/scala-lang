We are pleased to announce that the Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award for 2017 has been awarded to [Josh Suereth](https://twitter.com/jsuereth).  The award was presented in the UK's Lake District at [Scala World 2017](https://scala.world).

Josh has been a prominent member of the Scala community ever since the early
days of the language's commercial adoption.  He is known to Scala users as:

* author of _Scala in Depth_ and co-author of _sbt in Action_,
  both published by Manning
* maintainer of the [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) build tool
  for several years at Typesafe (the company now known as Lightbend)
* leader or contributor to numerous other open source Scala projects
  including scala-arm, pickling, and assorted sbt plugins
* cohost of the [Scalawags podcast](https://scalawags.tv)
  (and its predecessor, The Scala Types)
* a friendly and tireless conference-goer and presenter (and
  organizer of the Scala Lift Off unconference in Virginia in 2009)
* a positive force on nearly every online medium devoted to
  Scala -- mailing lists, chat rooms, Twitter, you name it --
  answering any and all questions with tact and humor

Here's a

of friends and colleagues paying tribute to Josh.  The video was shown
when the award was presented.

Josh's surname is pronounced "Suereth".

The Bagwell Award is named in honor of Phil Bagwell, who passed away in 2012.  In a [2012 blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20160311185839/https://www.lightbend.com/blog/rip-phil-bagwell), Martin Odersky remembers Phil and his special place in the Scala community.
