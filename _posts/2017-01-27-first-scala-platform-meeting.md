title: First Scala Platform meeting
---

On 17th January, the Scala Platform Committee had [its first
meeting](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/first-scala-platform-meeting/368).
With it, we kicked off the creation of the Scala Platform and begin the
incubation period for two libraries in the Scala ecosystem!
  
## Incubation period
  
The [incubation
period](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/adding-better-files-to-the-scala-platform/340/23?u=jvica://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/adding-better-files-to-the-scala-platform/340/23?u=jvican)
gives library maintainers time to create a Community around the project,
integrate with the Scala Platform infrastructure, and take time to plan releases
and clean up public APIs.
It will end when library maintainers feel the library
is ready for shipping with the Scala Platform, in which case the Scala Platform
Committee will vote its final acceptance.
  
## Progress on the meeting
  
The meeting focused around two main topics:
  
* Discussing high-level aspects of the [Scala Platform Process](http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/11/28/spp.html); and
* Reviewing three Community proposals to add projects to the Scala Platform.  These are:
    * [Better-files](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/adding-better-files-to-the-scala-platform/340/15):
      A new IO module to replace the one in the standard library.
    * [Enumeratum](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/adding-enumeratum-to-the-scala-platform/307/7):
      A library to write type-safe, deserializable enumerations in Scala.
    * [Scala JSON AST](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-json-ast-sp-proposal/175/25):
      A JSON AST that provides long-term binary compatibility and interop among
      Scala libraries.
  
Out of those proposals, the Committee decided to incubate [Better
files](https://github.com/pathikrit/better-files) and [Scala JSON
AST](https://github.com/mdedetrich/scala-json-ast), while postponing the
decision of adopting Enumeratum to our next meeting.

## Get involved!
  
At the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch), we are very happy to see this
collaborative effort get on track. In the upcoming days, we will work with
library maintainers to improve the Scala Platform infrastructure, incubate the
modules and ensure that the Community can contribute by opening pull requests,
improving documentation and participating in discussions at the Issue Tracker.
  
Chime in and get involved!  We're waiting for you on [Scala
Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org).
