We are pleased to announce that the Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award for 2018 has been awarded to [Kenji Yoshida](https://twitter.com/xuwei_k). The award was presented in Lausanne at the outset of [Scala Days](https://scaladays.org/) 2019.

<!-- the Scala Days link should be replaced with a 2019-specific link, once one is available -->

On stage, Eugene Yokota accepted the award on Yoshida-san's behalf.  You can watch the ceremony [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX3lxMhFDbs).  (The ceremony also included the 2019 award to Kelley Robinson.)

And here is a [tribute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-43ds0-pY) with remarks from Josh Suereth, Eugene Yokota, Rob Norris, and Miles Sabin.

## About the winner

Yoshida-san is known to Scala users as:

* Long-term maintainer of [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz), the first library to pioneer full support for pure-functional programming in Scala.
* Prominent contributor to Scala 2.13.  His many pull requests to the Scala repo were done while he was on parental leave in 2018.
* A ubiquitous presence in pull request queues across the Scala open-source world, in literally hundreds of projects.  Taken individually, his contributions are often small, but in aggregate, they are essential to our ecosystem's health.

Some of Yoshida-san's Japanese-language tweets are available in English translation at [@not_xuwei_k](https://twitter.com/not_xuwei_k).

## About the award

The Bagwell Award is named in honor of Phil Bagwell, who passed away in 2012. In a [2012 blog post](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/rip-phil-bagwell), Martin Odersky remembers Phil and his special place in the Scala community.
