We are very pleased to announce the release of Scala 2.11.2!

* Get started with the [Hello Scala 2.11 template](https://typesafe.com/activator/template/hello-scala-2_11) in [Typesafe Activator](https://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted)
* Download a distribution from [scala-lang.org](http://scala-lang.org/download/2.11.2.html)
* Obtain it via [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/?search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.scala-lang%22%20AND%20v%3A%222.11.2%22#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.scala-lang%22%20AND%20v%3A%222.11.2%22)

Scala 2.11.2 is a bugfix release that is binary compatible with previous releases in the Scala 2.11 series.
The changes include:

* Several [issues in the collections library](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8738?jql=project%20%3D%20SI%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Scala%202.11.2%22%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Collections%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC) were resolved, most notably equality on ranges ([SI-8738](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8738)).
* The optimizer no longer eliminates division instructions that may throw an `ArithmeticException` ([SI-7607](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7607)).
* The `-Xlint` compiler flag is now parameterized by individual warnings. This is intended to replace the `-Ywarn-...` options, for instance, `-Xlint:nullary-unit` is equivalent to `-Ywarn-nullary-unit`. Run `scalac -Xlint:help` to see all available options. Kudos to [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt)!
* TypeTags and Exprs are now serializable ([SI-5919](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5919)).

Compared to 2.11.1, this release resolves [49 issues](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8738?jql=project%20%3D%20SI%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Scala%202.11.2%22%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20fixed%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC). We reviewed and merged [70 pull requests](https://github.com/scala/scala/issues?milestone=38&state=closed).

The next minor Scala 2.11 release will be available in 2 months, or sooner if prompted by a serious issue.
