Brief summaries of both meetings follow, with links to
more details.

## Scala Center Advisory Board

On November 30, the Scala Center Advisory Board had their
quarterly meeting.

The board has two new members: Morgan Stanley, and an additional
community representative, Lars Hupel.

Scala Center activities for the past quarter included progress on the
MOOCs, Scalafix, scalajs-bundler, SIPs, the new Scala Platform
Process, Spores, Scala Native, Scastie, Scaladex, hackathons, and a
new code of conduct.

The following proposals were voted on and adopted:

* [SCP-007](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/007-collections.md): Collaborative redesign and implementation of Scala 2.13's collections library
* [SCP-008](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/008-websites.md): Maintain scala-lang, docs.scala-lang, scala.epfl.ch websites
* [SCP-009](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/009-improve-direct-dependency-experience.md): Improve user experience for builds that use only direct dependencies

## Scala Improvement Process (SIP) Committee

On October 25, the SIP committee had its monthly meeting.

There were procedural issues with the previous vote on [SIP-27](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/trailing-commas.html)
(Trailing commas), proposed by Dale Wijnand.  That vote was canceled
and the committee agreed on clarified voting rules.  A new vote on
SIP-27 was held under the new rules, and the proposal was accepted,
pending a final round of changes by Dale.

Also discussed was [SIP-20](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/improved-lazy-val-initialization.html) (Improved lazy val initialization),
proposed by Dmitry Petrashko and others.  The proposal was
marked as dormant, since it has only been implemented in Dotty.
A volunteer is needed to implement it in the main Scala compiler.

[minutes](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/minutes/sip-minutes.html).
