In 2015, 2.11 minor releases will be released quarterly, or sooner if prompted by a serious issue.

### Scala IDE
The current release of Scala IDE includes Scala 2.11.5 is available on the [download site](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html) (or as an update to version 4.0 of the plugin).

### Available Libraries and Frameworks

A large number of Scala projects have been released against Scala 2.11. Please refer to the list of [libraries and frameworks available for Scala 2.11](https://github.com/scala/make-release-notes/blob/2.11.x/projects-2.11.md).

### Reminder: Do Not Use Scala 2.11.3
Due to a [binary incompatibility](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8899) in Scala 2.11.3, we recommend upgrading to Scala 2.11.5, which resolves the incompatibility, as well as another [blocker issue](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8900) that was discovered in the days after the 2.11.3 release.

We have [analyzed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/SSD9BNJaFbU/rACBkHrs2JEJ) the mistakes that lead to the breakage (human error), and are taking measures to prevent this from happening again. We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank everyone who was involved in reporting and diagnosing these critical issues.

### Release Notes for the Scala 2.11 Series

The release notes for the Scala 2.11 series, which also apply to the current minor release, are available in the [release notes for Scala 2.11.1](http://scala-lang.org/news/2.11.1). They contain important information such as:

* The specification of binary compatibility between minor releases.
* Details on new features, important changes and deprecations in Scala 2.11.
