Last year, the Scala team and I developed a massive open online course
for Principles of Functional Programming in Scala on the Coursera
platform.  We were blown away by the success of that course. So far,
it got over 100'000 registrations, with one of the
[highest completion rates](http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html)
of any open online course.

Today, I am thrilled to announce together with the third iteration
of [Principles of Functional
Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) two new
offerings.

## Reactive Programming

First, there will be a successor to the course. It's called
[Principles of Reactive
Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive). I am
super-excited to co-teach the course together with Erik Meijer, of Rx
fame, and with Roland Kuhn, the tech lead of the Akka actors
framework. Reactive programming will assume a good grounding in
functional programming and will add topics such different forms of
monads, combining functions and state, composing with futures and
observables, and designing resilient actor systems.

Time wise, the two courses follow each other. Principles of Functional
Programming starts September 16 and goes for 7 weeks, then Principles
of Reactive Programming starts November 4 and also goes for 7 weeks.
So if you want learn about reactive programming but feel your Scala
skills could use some improvement, there's still time to enroll for
the functional programming course.

## Personalized Tutorials

In a second new development, Typesafe will offer [supervised tutorial
classes](http://typesafe.com/blog) that follow both classes and run concurrently with them. One
of the challenges of massive online courses is that students get only
automated feedback on their homework assignments. Using Typesafe's
online tutorial platform, students can enroll in small groups with
an expert tutor who will give detailed feedback on programming
techniques in their homework assignments and elsewhere.
