title: Three Scala courses launched on Coursera!
---

We're very happy to announce that the first 3 out of 4 courses in our Scala
specialization have launched on Coursera! The courses available today include:

- **Functional Programming Principles in Scala**: discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks.
- **Functional Program Design in Scala**: learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications.
- **Parallel Programming**: learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism.

As in the past, all courses feature the much-loved automatic grading of
programming assignments!

The final course in the pipeline is _Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark_,
which we're hoping will follow in a couple of months along with the Scala
capstone project – a ~4 week long project designed to push you to build a
larger, more challenging Scala application.

All courses are available both for free and as part of the Scala specialization,
which is a verified mini-degree from Coursera.
