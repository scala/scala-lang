With pride and a pang of nostalgia, we announce the availability of Scala 2.10.5 -- the last release in the 2.10.x series.

We'd like to encourage you to upgrade to 2.11.6 as soon as possible. (Please note that this announcement does not affect Typesafe's commercial support offering.)

Scala 2.10.5 is the final maintenance release in this series, and is binary compatible with previous releases in the Scala 2.10 series. We would like to highlight the following change:

 - We [fixed a cross-site scripting vulnerability](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4351) in Scaladoc's JavaScript. Many thanks to @todesking for discovering this, suggesting a fix, and for delaying disclosure until this release! This bug could be used to access sensitive information on sites hosted on the same domain as Scaladoc-generated documentation. All previous versions of Scaladoc are affected (Scala 2.11.6 includes the fix as well). We do recommend, as a general precaution, to host Scaladoc documentation on its own domain.

Compared to 2.10.4, this release resolves [10 issues](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SI%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%22Scala%202.10.5%22%29%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC). Out of 23, we [merged 18 pull requests](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+milestone%3A2.10.5). Before upgrading, please also check the [known issues](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SI%20AND%20status%3Dopen%20AND%20affectedVersion%20%3D%20%22Scala%202.10.5%22%20and%20fixVersion%20%3E%3D%20%22Scala%202.10.5%22%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC) for this release.
