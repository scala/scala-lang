title: "Contribution Equals Impact – Towards a Responsible, Sustainable, and Resilient Open Source Ecosystem for Scala"
---
Prepare yourselves for a series of exciting blog posts!  

We will be publishing a series of interviews with various stakeholder groups across open source in general and the Scala ecosystem in particular - ranging from individual contributors to board members to foundations and more.

The aim of this series is to inspire Scala users and stakeholders to participate in the Scala ecosystem development by showcasing concrete current success (and failure) stories. The final goal is to create a best practices guide that can help shape a sustainable and responsible Scala open source future.

We will cover a wide variety of topics, such as:

- What is a contribution and how do we measure its impact?
- Why do individuals, organizations and industry stakeholders contribute?
- What are the benefits of taking an active role in the ecosystem?
- How important is it for the health of the overall Scala ecosystem to attract new members and contributors? 
- Where can volunteers start with contributions?
- and more!

We believe that all contributions in an ecosystem are important and have an impact. An increase in contributions by all stakeholders will ensure greater symbiotic relationships within the Scala open source community and provide a positive impact on the longevity and resilience of the Scala ecosystem.

Therefore, let us *all* come together, engage and contribute to make Scala one of the world’s top programming languages, as well as a leader in sustainability and responsibility in its domain.
