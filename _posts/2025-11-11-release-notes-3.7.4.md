Scala 3.7.4 is now available!

## Notable changes

- Align coverage support with Scala 2, fixing multiple issues [#23722](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/23722)

- Deprecate `scala_legacy` /`MainGenericRunner`/`scalac -run`/`scalac -repl` for removal [#24267](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/24267). 
  These were deprecated since 3.5.0 and would be removed in 3.8.0.

- Bump Scala CLI to v1.9.1 (was v1.9.0) [#23962](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/23962):
  See the [Scala CLI release notes](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli/releases/tag/v1.9.1) for additional details
