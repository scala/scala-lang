title: "Scala Workshop (Scala2013) Program Announced!"
---
The [Scala2013 Workshop Program](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2013/program.html) is now available! We're quite excited about this year's program-- we received a record number of submissions, leading to a first-class program spanning compilation & metaprogramming, parallelism/concurrency, verification & synthesis, debugging tools and more!
 
In order to accomodate as many quality submissions as we could, we teamed up with the organizers of the [LaME'13](http://lame2013.dei.uc.pt/) workshop (short for "Languages for the Multicore Era") to co-sponsor a special Scala parallelism/concurrency session that will take place on July 1st. That means we will now be having Scala2013 talks on two days-- July 1st & 2nd.

Please join us this summer in Montpellier!
