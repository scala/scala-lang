Dear Scala Community,

February 24th 2022 will be remembered as a dark day in world history.
Something happened that most of us considered as unthinkable in the modern times: an unprovoked, ungrounded, full-scale military invasion by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.
In just the first four days of the war, by February 27th, 352 civilians [were killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-invasion-ukraine-kills-352-civilians-including-14-children-2022-02-27/), 14 of them were children.
In addition, many were wounded, and over a million people have been displaced from Ukraine.
Peaceful Ukrainian cities are being deliberately bombarded.

The Scala Center strongly condemns Russiaâ€™s military invasion of Ukraine and the associated tremendous violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.
We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragedy currently unfolding in Ukraine, and we would like to express our full solidarity with everyone affected by the war.
Our thoughts go out to all those directly or indirectly affected, both in Ukraine and Russia, including our friends and colleagues whose families live in the affected areas.

Mere words, however, are not enough in the current situation.
More than ever, Ukraine is in need of the world's help.
These are some of the steps we are taking, and we hope to inspire you to take action too:

* Reach out to your friends and colleagues who are directly affected. Be there for them. Take inventory of what help you can personally offer -- emotional, financial support, shelter, etc. -- and offer it to them.
* Support your friends and colleagues in the neighbouring countries, who are welcoming the people escaping the conflict areas.
* Inform people around you about the unfolding crisis. Many, especially in the countries far from the affected areas, may not realise the extent of what's happening. Informing them is crucial to rally support. Share information responsibly -- check your sources.
* Help financially, for example [donate to the Ukrainian Red Cross](https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/ua/donate/).
* More ways to help are listed in [#StandWithUkraine](https://www.standwithukraine.app/) or [GlobalCitizen: Meaningful Ways You Can Help Ukraine](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/ways-to-help-ukraine-conflict/).
* Find out ways you can help that are specific to your country of residence.

We are sincerely grateful to everyone who has taken action so far.
All over the planet we see individuals and companies self-organise to provide humanitarian aid and shelter to the affected people.
Countries send all sorts of help and provide assistance.
Hundreds of thousands of people all over the world have brought peaceful anti-war protests to the streets.
Having the entire world side by the righteous cause gives us hope that the good will prevail.
