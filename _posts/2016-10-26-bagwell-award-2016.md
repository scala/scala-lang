title: "Erik Osheim receives community award"
---
We are pleased to announce that the Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award for 2016 has been awarded to [Erik Osheim](https://twitter.com/d6).  The award was presented in Lake District, UK at [Scala World 2016](https://scala.world).

Erik is known to Scala users as:

* creator of [Spire](https://github.com/non/spire), a leading library for numerics in Scala
* creator of other tools and libraries such as [kind-projector](https://github.com/non/kind-projector) (a compiler plugin for type lambdas) and [jawn](https://github.com/non/jawn/) (a very fast JSON parser)
* leader of the [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) project, which provides abstractions for functional programming in Scala ("cats" being short for "category", as in category theory)
* cofounder of [Typelevel](http://typelevel.org), a Scala community organization dedicated to furthering pure, typeful functional programming in Scala
* a friendly and tireless conference-goer and presenter

Erik's 2015 Scala World presentation, "Principles for approachable,
modular, functional libraries"
([slides](http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik/sw2015-inv.pdf),
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKyIKozv8a8)) is a classic on
the subject of open-source library design, not only from a technical
perspective, but with attention to how software communities and
ecosystems operate.

The Bagwell Award is named in honor of Phil Bagwell, who passed away in 2012.  In a [2012 blog post](https://www.typesafe.com/blog/rip-phil-bagwell), Martin Odersky remembers Phil and his special place in the Scala community.
