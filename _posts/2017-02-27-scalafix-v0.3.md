title: "Refactor with scalafix v0.3"
---

I am happy to announce the release of [scalafix v0.3][scalafix], a library and tool to rewrite Scala source code.
Scalafix is developed at the [Scala Center][sc] with the long-term mission to help automate the migration of between Scala versions.
However, as I hope to demonstrate in this post, scalafix can be used for more than just migrating between Scala versions.
Scalafix can also be used for ad-hoc library and application migrations.

Scalafix v0.3 uses the new scala.meta semantic API to provide a re-designed `Rewrite` and `Patch` API to implement custom refactorings.
Let me explain what that means word by word.

## Scala.meta semantic API

Scala.meta recently announced the [first release of its semantic API][meta-1.6].
This release is the product of close collaboration for the past several months between
[@xeno_by][] at Twitter and [myself][@olafurpg] at the Scala Center.
The objective of the semantic API is to provide operations to query information from the compiler.

The first version of the scala.meta semantic API makes it possible to query for the resolved "symbol" of a name that appears in a Scala source file.
A name is a reference to some definition, for example `println` or `scala.Predef.println`.
A symbol is a unique identifier of a single definition.
For example, `println` from the standard library has the symbol `_root_.scala.Predef.println(Ljava/lang/Object;)V.`.
The compiler is responsible for resolving names to symbols.

[Scalahost][] is a compiler plugin in the scala.meta project that extracts symbols from the compiler and maps them to scala.meta syntax trees.
Scalahost emits the extracted symbols into a "semantic database".
The semantic database can be persisted to files on disk and loaded for later analysis.
Semantic databases from different compilation units, potentially produced by different
versions of the Scala compiler, can be merged.
This opens possibilities for large-scale code analysis.

The introduction of the scala.meta semantic API is a game changer for scalafix.
The ability to resolve names to symbols opens possibilities for many scalafix rewrites.
Before we cover a few example rewrites, let's look closer at what exactly "rewrite" means.

## Rewrite: meta.Tree => Seq[Patch]
In a nutshell, a scalafix `Rewrite` is a `scala.meta.Tree => Seq[Patch]` function.
The tree is backed by the scala.meta semantic API, so the rewrite is able to query for compiler information such as symbols.
A scalafix `Patch` is a small operation that can produce a diff on a Scala source file.
A patch can either be a "token patch" or a "tree patch".

Token patches are low-level but give full control over how every detail in a source file is handled, for example formatting and comments.
Example token patches are `Remove(token)` and `AddLeft(token, toAdd: String)`, which removes or prepends a string to `token`, respectively.

Tree patches are high-level and allow the rewrite author to declaratively explain what operation to perform.
An example tree patch is `AddGlobalImport(importer)`, which adds a new import to the top of a file if it does not exist.
Observe that `AddGlobalImport` does not worry about token-level details such as whether the user groups imports by prefix (`import a.{b, c}`) or not (`import a.b; import a.c`).

Tree and token patches build a small algebra of operations that can be composed to build complex refactorings.
A challenge with composing patches is to figure out what to do on conflicts.
For example, what happens when one patch renames a token while the other patch removes the same token?
The current strategy in scalafix is to try and resolve as many conflicts as possible on the tree patch level.
It can be harder to resolve conflicts on the token level since the original intent of the patch is lost.
Unsolvable conflicts abort the refactoring.
In the future, we hope to support more advanced conflict resolution strategies.

To demonstrate how rewrites are implemented with scalafix v0.3, let's step through an example use-case.

## Example: Xor to Either

The functional programming library [cats][] migrated recently from its `Xor` data type to `Either` from the standard library.
It requires a few mechanical steps to migrate code to use `Either` instead of `Xor`.
For example, below is a diff that's taken from [circe][]'s migration to `Either`.

```diff
-final def either: Xor[HCursor, HCursor] = if (succeeded) Xor.right(any) else Xor.left(any)
+final def either: Either[HCursor, HCursor] = if (succeeded) Right(any) else Left(any)
```

For this particular rewrite, we are able to get away with only using tree patches.
`Replace` is one tree patch that can be used to replace usage of a reference such as a type, term or a static method.

```scala
Replace(Symbol("_root_.cats.data.Xor."), q"Either")
Replace(Symbol("_root_.cats.data.Xor.Left."), q"Left")
Replace(Symbol("_root_.cats.data.Xor.Right."), q"Right")
```

The `Symbol(_root_...data.Xor)` part is the scala.meta symbol referencing the class definition of `cats.data.Xor`.
As we saw in the `either: Xor[HCursor` diff above, references to `Xor` should become `Either` after the rewrite.

Symbols are normalized by default, so the `cats.data.Xor.Right` replace patch will handle the `Xor.Right` type, `Xor.Right` companion object as well as the `Right.apply` constructor method.

To introduce new imports, it's possible to pass in `additionalImports`

```scala
Replace(Symbol("_root_.cats.data.XorT."), q"EitherT",
        additionalImports = List(importer"cats.data.EitherT")),
```

Imports can be removed with the `RemoveGlobalImport` patch

```scala
RemoveGlobalImport(importer"cats.data.Xor")
```

Nothing happens if the import does not appear in the source file.
Likewise, it's OK to add the same import twice, scalafix will de-duplicate it.

The full `Xor` to `Either` scalafix rewrite can be found [here][xor2either] and its accompanying test
suite [here][xor2either-test].

## Try it out!
You can use scalafix both as a library and a tool.

The recommended way to use scalafix as a library is with the [`sbt-scalahost`][sbt-scalahost] plugin.
By using scalafix as a library, you have full control of how, where and when to run rewrites.

The recommended way to use scalafix as tool is the [`sbt-scalafix`][sbt-scalafix] plugin.
It's possible define custom tree patches in the [`.scalafix.conf` configuration file][config-patches].

I am excited to see what applications the community can build with scala.meta and scalafix.
Some promising ideas that have floated around include

- parse and run rewrites from `@deprecated` warning messages. This would enable
  library authors to provide executable migration guides.
- shim/cross-build libraries with similar APIs. For example,
  a library could be developed with the scalaz API, and use scalafix to
  code-generate a version of the library that uses cats instead.
- build a code search web-interface with "jump to definition" functionality
  powered by the scala.meta's semantic database (similar to [sxr][]).
- replace usage of `any2stringadd` with string interpolators or explicit `.toString`.
- replace usage of `scala.Seq`, which can be mutable, in favor of `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`.

If this sounds exciting to you, join us!
I am happy to answer any question in the [scalafix gitter][gitter] channel.

PS. I want to thank [@ShaneDelmore][] who has provided invaluable feedback from
the early days of scalafix development and come up with several brilliant ideas
for scalafix use-cases.
