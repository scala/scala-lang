title: "Write Scala in VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Atom and Sublime Text with Metals"
---

We are excited to announce the release of
[Metals v0.5](https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2020/04/12/mercury.html). Metals
is a Scala language server that supports code completions, type at point, goto
definition, fuzzy symbol search and other advanced code editing and navigation
capabilities.

Metals can be used in VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Atom and Sublime Text as well as any
other
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
compatible editor. Metals works with sbt, Gradle, Maven and Mill thanks to
[Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/), a fast Scala build server. Adding
support for other build tools is possible through the
[Build Server Protocol](https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp/blob/master/docs/bsp.md).

Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) along with
contributors from the community.

## Features

In this post we are going to demonstrate how to use Metals with VS Code. To get
started, install the
[Scala (Metals)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals)
extension on the VS Code Marketplace and open an sbt project directory. The
Metals extension will prompt you to import the build.

The build import step can take a while to run and once complete, you can enjoy
the features of Metals.

### Diagnostics

Syntax errors update as you type and type errors are published on file save.

A
[separate `bloop` command-line interface](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/setup)
can be installed to test and run programs from a terminal using the same
compilation artifacts as Metals.

### Type at point

Hover over an identifier to see its expression type, symbol signature and
documentation.

Observe how the active expression is highlighted as the cursor moves.

### Code completions

As you type, code completions are suggested for a range of use-cases such as
overriding a method from a superclass or generating an exhaustive pattern match
for a sealed type.

Observe that imports are automatically inserted as you complete symbols that are
not present in the scope.

### Parameter hints

When writing arguments for a method call, use parameter hints to see the method
signature and available method overloads.

### Goto definition

Jump to symbol definitions in your project sources and Scala/Java library
dependencies.

### Find references

Find all usages of a symbol in the workspace, including implicits and `apply`
methods.

### And more

Visit the
[Metals documentation](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/overview.html)
to learn more about other supported features. The website also includes
instructions for how to use Metals with the editors Vim, Emacs, Atom and Sublime
Text. However, note that the best supported editor is VS Code.

## Collaboration with VirtusLab

As part of a new collaboration between the Scala Center and
[VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com/), VirtusLab will be contributing engineers to
work on Metals over the coming months. The VirtusLab engineers
Marek Żarnowski and
[Tomasz Godzik (@tgodzik)](https://github.com/tgodzik) have already contributed
several impressive pull requests:

- `textDocument/foldingRange`
  ([#632](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/632)): code folding that
  understands Scala syntax.
- `textDocument/documentHighlight`
  ([#621](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/621)): highlight occurrences
  of a symbol in the current file.
- `textDocument/completion`
  ([#640](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/640)): override def
  completions without the need to type "override def ".

It is our pleasure to welcome Marek and Tomasz to the team and we look forward
to working together with them to improve the Scala code editing experience.

## Future work

Metals currently does not support several common IDE features:

- Refactorings such as rename symbol, add missing import, add inferred result
  type, move class, extract value.
- Running a main function or unit test with attached debugger.
- Triggering code completions, type at point and goto definition in `*.sbt`
  files.
- Working with hybrid `*.scala` and `*.java` projects, although you can try
  using the
  [Eclipse Java Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) for
  editing `*.java` only projects.

Metals may not be a good fit if you frequently rely on these features. You might
want to try [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) instead, which has
great Scala support and implements all of the features listed above.

## Share your feedback

Please give Metals a try and share your feedback on

[Metals GitHub repository](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/).

## Credits

Code completions, type at point and parameter hints are implemented using the
Scala presentation compiler, which is maintained by the Scala compiler team at
Lightbend.

Metals started as a fork of the
[dragos-vscode-scala](https://github.com/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala) repository
in late 2017 and has since then grown into a project with over 40 contributors:
