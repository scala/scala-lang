Scala 2.10.6 [resolves a license incompatibility in scala.util.Sorting](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4557), but is otherwise identical to Scala 2.10.5. A total of [three pending backports](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=milestone%3A2.10.6+is%3Aclosed) were merged.

We strongly encourage you to upgrade to the latest stable version of Scala 2.11.x, as the 2.10.x series is no longer actively maintained.
