<h2>Organizing a Scala Event?</h2>

If you are considering organizing a Scala-related conference, we maintain a private spreadsheet of announced and pre-announcement conferences to help organizers co-ordinate their plans, and avoid choosing conflicting dates for their events.

To gain access to the spreadsheet, and share your plans, please contact <a href="https://twitter.com/propensive/">Jon Pretty</a>.
