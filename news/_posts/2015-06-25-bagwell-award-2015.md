We are pleased to announce that the Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award for 2015 has been awarded to [Bill Venners](https://twitter.com/bvenners).  The award was presented in Amsterdam at the outset of [Scala Days](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-amsterdam-2015).

Bill is known to Scala users as:

* creator of [ScalaTest](http://scalatest.org), a popular open-source test framework first [released in 2008](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=222678), as well as other tools and libraries such as [Scalactic](http://www.scalactic.org)
* co-author of the first Scala book, [_Programming in Scala_](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed) (Artima)
* founder of [Artima](http://www.artima.com/aboutartima.html), which continues to publish [Scala-themed books](http://www.artima.com/shop/catalog), and hosted Scala-themed blogs and forums which were important in spreading the news about Scala in its early years
* friendly and tireless conference-goer, presenter, and trainer

The Bagwell Award is named in honor of Phil Bagwell, who passed away in 2012.  In a [2012 blog post](https://www.typesafe.com/blog/rip-phil-bagwell), Martin Odersky remembers Phil and his special place in the Scala community.
