We are thrilled to announce that our 4 main MOOCs are now also available
on an [Open edX instance managed at EPFL](https://courseware.epfl.ch).

[![](/resources/img/courseware-scala-moocs.png)](https://courseware.epfl.ch/)

[Open edX](https://open.edx.org) is an open source learning management system that
was originally developed by the [edX](https://edx.org) nonprofit.

The content of the courses remains the same as the ones on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala). The differences
are that our platform is free to use and doesnâ€™t deliver certificates.

Our goal is to deliver the courses content in the most accessible way. We
hope you will enjoy the learning experience provided by the Open edX platform.

Happy learning!
