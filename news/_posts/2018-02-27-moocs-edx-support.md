We are thrilled to announce that our 4 main MOOCs are now also available
on an [Open edX instance managed at EPFL](https://courseware.epfl.ch).

[![](/resources/img/courseware-scala-moocs.png)](https://courseware.epfl.ch/)

The content of the courses remains the same as the ones on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala). The differences
are that our platform is free to use and doesnâ€™t deliver certificates (official credentials
that confirm that you successfully completed a course).

As a reminder, the courses are the following:

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+progfun1+2018_T1/info):
  An introduction to functional programming (pure functions, recursion, pattern matching, higher-order
  functions, immutable data types, type parameters, equational reasoning),
- [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+progfun2+2018_T1/info):
  A follow-up of the first course, showing how to apply the functional programming style
  to larger programs. Covers topics such as monads, lazy evaluation, property-based testing,
  futures and dataflow programming.
- [Parallel Programming](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+parprog1+2018_T1/info):
  Introduces the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism,
- [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+scala-spark-big-data+2018-T1/info):
  Extends the data parallel paradigm to the distributed case (as opposed to shared-memory parallel
  or sequential collections), using Spark.

[Open edX](https://open.edx.org) is an open source learning management system that
was originally developed by the [edX](https://edx.org) nonprofit.

Our goal is to deliver the courses content in the most accessible way. We
hope you will enjoy the learning experience provided by the Open edX platform.

Happy learning!
