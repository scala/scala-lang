The [2019 Northeast Scala Symposium][NEScala]
[Call for Papers][CFP] is open.

We're looking for many different kinds of talks, at all levels of expertise,
from rank novice to brain-bending expert. The community will vote on the
talks, but the talks will be anonymized. We'll be voting on _topics_, not
speakers.

Be creative in your talk proposals. Propose a talk on _anything_ that might be
of interest to the Scala community. Possible topics include, but aren't
limited to:

- the Scala language, ecosystem, or tooling
- functional programming—in any language, not just Scala
- big data and data science (even if you absolutely must use Python)

In short, _anything_ you think might interest Scala programmers is fair game.

For more details, see the [CFP][].

This year, we’ve begun to work hard on diversity. We’ve engaged with the folks
at [Bridgewater Associates](https://www.bridgewater.com/), who have experience 
in that area. We’ve refined our code of conduct (a draft of which you can find
on our [web site][NEScala]). We’re trying to reach out to groups beyond the
usual demographics that dominate the Scala community and the industry at large.

We’re specifically seeking a more diverse speaker pool, and we also want to
make the conference a safe place for everyone. While we retain our
community-focused “attendees vote on the talks” approach, we’re holding back
some talk slots for speakers with more diverse backgrounds. We’re trying to
set aside some funds to help defray travel costs for such speakers. We’re
putting in place feedback and reporting mechanisms and well-defined escalation
procedures to try to make the conference a safer space for all attendees.

The [2019 Northeast Scala Symposium][NEScala] will be held in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvana, US, along with the 
[2019 Typelevel Summit Philadelphia](https://typelevel.org/event/2019-04-summit-philadelphia/),
April 1 through April 3. Tickets will go on sale starting next week, at $75.

Please consider joining us!
