We are extremely excited to announce the release of a new MOOC:
[Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems)!

This seven weeks long course teaches how to use “reactive programming” techniques
for implementing scalable, resilient and responsive systems. Skills you will learn
include:

- use, transform and sequence asynchronous computations using `Future` values,
- write concurrent systems based on [Akka](https://akka.io) actors,
- design systems resilient to failures,
- implement systems that can scale out according to a varying workload,
- define well-typed communication protocols using **Akka Typed**,
- process large streams of data with limited resources using **Akka Streams**,
- understand how back-pressure controls flows of data.

The course is taught by two experts of the field:

- **Roland Kuhn**, former Akka team lead and co-author of the
  [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/),
- **Konrad Malawski**, long-time Akka team and
  [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) expert group member.

In case you have followed the former “Principles of Functional Reactive
Programming in Scala” course a couple of years ago, this course contains updated
material as well as three weeks of new material on Akka Typed and Akka Streams.

The first session will start on February 18th, 2019! You can sign up and audit the
course for free or pursue a certificate.
