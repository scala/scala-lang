  The Scala Programming Language is an open source project, created at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) by
  [Prof. Martin Odersky](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/). Decisions on major language changes are made by
  the community through the Scala Improvement Process (SIP).
  Scala's associated websites and user forums are managed by the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch).
  The Scala Tooling Summit is coordinated by the Scala Center, bringing together the various teams and organizations
  that maintain tools for Scala to collaborate and improve the tooling experience for all.
  Recommendations for
  the Scala Center's activities can be made by [joining its Advisory Board](https://scala.epfl.ch/corporate-membership.html).
  Major contributions to the Scala language come from the Scala Center, [Martin's research group at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lamp/), and
  the Scala teams at [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com).
  Contributions also come from the Scala community more broadly, with participation
  from many companies, organizations, and individuals.

          The Scala Center contributes to the language core, open source Scala tooling and libraries, and
          delivers high-quality education materials.
          It fosters conversations in the community, and coordinates with various parties to unblock and improve
          the Scala ecosystem.
          [Joining the Advisory Board](https://scala.epfl.ch/corporate-membership.html) is an effective way to
          have your voice heard, as well as supporting the Center to achieve its goals.
