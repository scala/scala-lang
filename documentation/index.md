## The Scala Documentation Site

Your main entry point into online documentation on Scala is the official documentation site, [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org/). It contains a growing number of articles, guides and tutorials. The following list highlights some of the most important documents, but the doc site contains much more than that!
-->


## Online Learning

There are a few interactive resources for trying out Scala, to get a look and feel of the language:

 * [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), free on Coursera. This is a course about functional programming given by Martin Odersky himself. You can access the course material and exercises by
 signing up for the course.
 * [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) on Coursera. This is a course about concurrency and event-based asynchronous programming in Scala. You can access the course material and exercises by signing up for the course.
 * **Try Scala In Your Browser!**: There are a handful of websites where you can interactively run Scala code in your browser! Have a look at [scala-js-fiddle](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/), [Scala Kata](http://www.scalakata.com/), and [Scastie](http://scastie.org/) for more.
 * [Independent Courseware](http://getscala.com), online self-study or instructor-led Scala and Play courses for a fee.

## Books

There are more and more books being published about Scala. [Here]({{ site.baseurl  }}/documentation/books.html), you can find just a small selection of the many available titles.


## Bleeding Edge

If you are interested in finding out about the hottest, most pressing issues of tomorrow in the Scala world, have a look at the
[Scala Improvement Process (SIP) page](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/).

## Older Documentation

The documentation below may be a bit outdated, but provides insights into the (historical) design principles of
the language :

 * [Brief Scala Tutorial](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf): a 20 page introduction to scala and some of the basic concepts and a good place to start. You will find more code examples [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/219).
 * [Scala By Example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf): takes you through the Scala features with many examples. It does assume that you are already familiar with the basic Scala syntax and a basic understanding of functional programming. It is an excellent way to expand your knowledge and skill.
 * [Scala Overview](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaOverview.pdf): this is a paper summarizing the features of the Scala Language in a formal and concise way. An excellent reference for language researchers or advanced programmers.
 * [Java to Scala with the Help of Experts](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/960): a collection of some of the almost endless supply of tips available for Java programmers new to Scala. There are also mini-blog series designed to take you through many of the important features of the Scala language in a friendly way.

<!-- ## Research

Scala is also a very useful language to do research on/in. You can find Scala-related publications at the
[LAMP research page](http://lamp.epfl.ch/publications). Other Scala-related research material can be found on the
[Scala Days](http://days2012.scala-lang.org/) website and the [Scala2013](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2013/) workshop website. For an in-depth view of the technical details of the language, you may also find of interest the [Scala Language Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/archive/nightly/pdfs/ScalaReference.pdf).
