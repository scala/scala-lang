## Online Learning

There are a few interactive resources for trying out Scala, to get a look and feel of the language:

 * [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), free on Coursera. This is a course about functional programming given by Martin Odersky himself. You can access the course material and exercises by
 signing up for the course.
 * [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala), free on Coursera. The Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses material and exercises by signing up for the specialization. Includes the following courses:
    * Functional Programming Principles in Scala
    * Functional Program Design in Scala
    * Parallel programming
    * Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark
    * Functional Programming in Scala Capstone
 * **Try Scala In Your Browser!**: There are a handful of websites where you can interactively run Scala code in your browser! Have a look at [scala-js-fiddle](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/), [Scala Kata](http://www.scalakata.com/), and [Scastie](http://scastie.org/) for more.
 * [Independent Courseware](http://getscala.com), online self-study or instructor-led Scala and Play courses for a fee.

## Books

There are more and more books being published about Scala. [Here]({{ site.baseurl  }}/documentation/books.html), you can find just a small selection of the many available titles.


## Bleeding Edge

If you are interested in finding out about the hottest, most pressing issues of tomorrow in the Scala world, have a look at the
[Scala Improvement Process (SIP) page](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/).

## Older Documentation

The documentation below may be a bit outdated, but provides insights into the (historical) design principles of
the language :

 * [Brief Scala Tutorial](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf): a 20 page introduction to scala and some of the basic concepts and a good place to start. You will find more code examples [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/219).
 * [Scala By Example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf): takes you through the Scala features with many examples. It does assume that you are already familiar with the basic Scala syntax and a basic understanding of functional programming. It is an excellent way to expand your knowledge and skill.
 * [Scala Overview](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaOverview.pdf): this is a paper summarizing the features of the Scala Language in a formal and concise way. An excellent reference for language researchers or advanced programmers.
 * [Java to Scala with the Help of Experts](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/960): a collection of some of the almost endless supply of tips available for Java programmers new to Scala. There are also mini-blog series designed to take you through many of the important features of the Scala language in a friendly way.
