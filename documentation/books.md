"Scala in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that introduces Scala
through clear explanations and numerous hands-on examples. Because Scala
is a rich and deep language, it can be daunting to absorb all the new
concepts at once. This book takes a "how-to" approach, explaining
language concepts as you explore familiar programming challenges that
you face in your day-to-day work. You won't just get the theory of
functional programming. Instead, you'll learn to do concurrent
programming using Scala's Actors and Akka libraries. You won't just
discuss integration strategies, you'll learn to effectively mix Scala
and Spring. You won't just talk about ways to simplify programming,
you'll learn to build DSLs and other productivity tools."

Both are industry experts, Alex Payne being the lead API programmer at
Twitter, a social networking service based on
Scala. O’Reilly, the
publisher, writes:

"Learn how to be more productive with Scala, a new multi-paradigm
language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that integrates features of
both object-oriented and functional programming. With this book, you'll
discover why Scala is ideal for highly scalable, component-based
applications that support concurrency and distribution. You'll also
learn how to leverage the wealth of Java class libraries to meet the
practical needs of enterprise and Internet projects more easily."

"While information about the Scala language is abundant, skilled
practitioners, great examples, and insight into the best practices of
the community are harder to find. Scala in Depth bridges that gap,
preparing you to adopt Scala successfully for real world projects. Scala
in Depth is a unique new book designed to help you integrate Scala
effectively into your development process. By presenting the emerging
best practices and designs from the Scala community, it guides you
though dozens of powerful techniques example by example. There's no
heavy-handed theory here-just lots of crisp, practical guides for coding
in Scala."

"Getting code to do what we want it to do is perhaps the essence of our purpose as developers.
So there are few things more intriguing or important than code that we think we understand, but that behaves rather contrary to our expectations.

Scala Puzzlers is a collection of such examples in Scala. It is not only an entertaining and instructive way of understanding this highly expressive language better. It will also help you recognize many counter-intuitive traps and pitfalls and prevent them from inflicting further production bug hunt stress on Scala developers."
