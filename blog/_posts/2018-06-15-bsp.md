title: "Announcing the Build Server Protocol v1.0.0"
---

The choice of an editor, IDE or build tool is personal and, therefore, asking
you to go out of your way to learn a new tool to write Scala is not a viable
solution. First, because changing people's habits is difficult and takes time.
Second, it frustrates beginners who just want to learn the language. Last, it
distracts seasoned developers from writing good Scala code until they master
their toolchain. In the worst case, people will give up and not learn the
language because the "cognitive overhead" would be too high.

Instead it is much better if we, tooling developers, can bear the burden of
shipping tools that integrate with your existing workflow and you, as a user,
can just install them with a quick search and a single click.

Today, we introduce the Build Server Protocol, a project that we believe plays
a fundamental role in bringing us closer to making this vision a reality.

## Any IDE, Any Build Tool

Traditionally, every IDE has implemented a custom integration for each
supported build tool in order to extract build information such as classpaths
or source directories for every project in your build. This information is
necessary for the IDE to present you with a workspace where you can browse,
write and compile Scala code. Every time you "Import Project" from IntelliJ
or Eclipse, the IDE carries out this process on the background.

Likewise, all build tools are expected to integrate with all available IDEs.
Most of them allow you to export their build to an external project model so
that user adoption is not hurt by lack of official IDE support. This support
isn't as thorough and polished as the one provided by IDEs, but usually gets
the job done at the expense of supported features.

So, IDEs create their own custom build tool integrations and build tools
provide their own custom IDE integrations. Why should you care?

It turns out the growing number of language servers and build tools in the
wider programming community means tooling developers spend a lot of time
working on these integrations. This work, that needs to be duplicated on each
side every time there is a new IDE or build tool and distracts developers
from working on bugfixes and performance improvements, ends up affecting
us -- their end users. This is a big deal; we developers rely on build tools and
IDEs for everything! If they are slow to evolve and maintain, then our
developer experience takes a hit.

The idea behind the Build Server Protocol is to standardize the protocol for
how build tools (servers) and IDEs (clients) communicate, so a single Build
Server can be re-used in multiple IDEs, and IDEs can support build tools with
minimal effort.

As a result, end users are provided with the best developer experience and
tooling developers can improve the quality of their integrations with less
effort and time, without locking out a part of the programming language
community from good language support. This is especially important for the
Scala community that has had a lot of recent activity in the build tools
space with the increasing adoption of build tools like [Pants], [Bazel] or
[mill].

### Relationship with the Language Server Protocol

BSP is a win for both IDEs implementors, build tool vendors and their users!
But this is, in fact, not the first time this idea is applied to tools.
Microsoft's [Language Server Protocol][LSP] (LSP) applied the same concept to
language servers and editors. What is then BSP's relationship with LSP?

BSP and LSP are complementary. While LSP specifies endpoints for
communication between an *editor acting as a client* and a language server,
BSP specifies endpoints between a *language server acting as a client* and a
build server.

It turns out that if we want to create language servers to support Scala in
editors like Visual Studio Code, `vim` or Sublime, we also need to integrate
with build tools to support features like compiler diagnostics or code
navigation. One of the main properties of BSP is that it can be implemented
alongside LSP.

## The Build Server Protocol v1.0.0

Today we have released `v1.0.0` of the Build Server Protocol. This version has
been the result of a fruitful collaboration between the Scala Center ([Jorge
Vicente Cantero][jvican] and [Ólafur Páll Geirsson][olafurpg]) and JetBrains
([Justin Kaeser][jastice]).

We have spent the past months implementing a prototype of the Build Server
Protocol between [IntelliJ IDEA] (client) and [Bloop] (server). Bloop is
a build-tool-agnostic compilation server that integrates with build tools such
as [sbt], [mill] or [Maven] to allow you [to compile, test and run your
applications much faster and outside of your stock build
tool](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/11/30/bloop-release.html). Bloop has
a client-server architecture, so it is the perfect project to implement BSP.

The goal of this prototype was two-fold. On the one hand, we wanted to
experience first-hand the challenges of implementing BSP and learn new
insights to improve the protocol. On the other hand, we wanted to provide
Scala developers a faster "Import Project" that would work across different
build tools *now*, even though build tools don't yet provide implementations
of build servers.

[The first version of
BSP](https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp/blob/master/docs/bsp.md) has been
designed to support the most basic language integration in an IDE/editor.
IDEs can find all the modules defined in a workspace, ask for their
dependencies, compile, test, run, and get notifications on modified build
targets, among a few other features.

Our IntelliJ-Bloop implementation doesn't yet implement all these endpoints.
Instead, it focuses on providing a faster integration than the traditional
project import. You can now import your project, browse Scala code with full
language support and get compiler diagnostics from the build tool in
IntelliJ's editor.

The process to import project via BSP is as follows:

1. Export your build to Bloop. The Bloop server will immediately pick up these
   changes.
2. Import the build from Bloop to your IDE via BSP.

<p></p><!-- To give more space between list and next paragraph. -->

In total, this two-step process takes up to **15 seconds** in a medium-sized
build where all the dependencies have already been fetched. It is already
available in IntelliJ EAP 2018.2 under a experimental flag. To try the
prototype out, read [the full instructions to get Bloop and IntelliJ set
up](https://gist.github.com/jastice/212227aa5fc29426aeea3b93280bcd8a).

You can see it on this demo importing [akka/akka](https://github.com/akka/akka/):

The two-step process is fast, but it currently requires too much user
intervention and needs to be repeated every time something changes in the
build. What can we do to improve it?

Bloop could do a better job at exporting your sbt build every time you start
up your sbt shell or `reload` your build to pick up new changes. This would
remove the need for the first step. But the process is still arduous for
users; they need to still perform the manual step of reloading the project
every time the build tool and IDE go out of sync.

BSP has been designed to deal with this issue from the start. The fact that
it encourages a bidirectional communication between the build tool and the
IDE means that build tools can send notifications to IDEs whenever there is a
change in your build. What's most interesting is that a future release of a
build tool supporting BSP would suffice to provide this state-of-the-art
project import experience instantly.

Aside from importing your build, the BSP prototype also allows you to get
compiler diagnostics directly from your build tool instead of diagnostics
from IntelliJ's presentation compiler. Build tool diagnostics are always
correct since the compilation happens in your build tool and the results
are streamed to the IDE.

Scalasphere 2018.

## Next steps

The next steps will focus on increasing adoption of the protocol and
enhancing the availability and quality of the integrations for users.

First, the Scala Center will keep collaborating with Jetbrains to improve
IntelliJ's BSP import for Bloop and other build tools. The goal is to bring
BSP import to a production-ready level where users can benefit from a
build-tool-agnostic import project that is both faster and more reliable.

Second, we'd like to invest some resources in creating a better synergy
between build tool authors and IDE implementors. The [Scala Tooling Protocols
Working Group](https://github.com/scalacenter/tooling-working-groups/)
created by [Jon
Pretty](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2018/02/14/tooling.html) a few months
ago will help us discuss and refine the protocol so that all tooling
developers in our community can implement the protocol at scale and gain more
experience from this process.

Third, we'd like to collaborate more closely with developers working on Scala
language servers like [Metals] or Dotty IDE to bring Scala support to all
editors. There is a big chunk of Scala developers that don't use IntelliJ and
we'd like to make sure that they benefit from a smooth developer experience
too.

Last but not least, we'd like to reach out to folks in other programming
language communities to find out ways we can pull our efforts together.
The Build Server Protocol is **a language-agnostic protocol that can be
modified to add support for any programming language** and we would love to see
other communities improving the future of the build tools and IDE
communication.
