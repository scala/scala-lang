title: "Scala 2 maintenance plans"
---

In October 2024, we published a [Scala Development Guarantees](https://www.scala-lang.org/development/) page that lays out our policies for the Scala 3 LTS (Long Term Support) and Scala Next version lines.

We have now expanded this page to also cover **Scala 2**.

In summary,

> Maintenance of **Scala 2.13** will continue indefinitely.

> Minimal maintenance of **Scala 2.12** will continue as long as sbt 1 remains in wide use.

For more details, please visit [the page](https://www.scala-lang.org/development/).
