### Summary
We are happy to announce that for the fourth year in a row, we are supporting the Scala Community's participation in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for 2024! _(Look [here](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2024/01/10/advent-of-code-recap.html) for a recap of 2023's edition)._

> Advent of Code, organised by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) is a yearly event consisting of a series of small programming puzzles. The puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. The goal is to improve your understanding of your programming language of choice by solving as many puzzles as possible.

### Discord channel

In 2021, the Scala Center began a tradition of participating in the challenge.
This year, we invite you to join us again! We have re-opened the `#advent-of-code` [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/632150470000902164/913451015246868530) at the official [Scala Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/scala).

Here you can discuss the puzzles, share solutions, and ask for help.

### Read and share solutions on our website

We have also created a new section for the 2024 edition on the [Scala Center Advent of Code website](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2024/).
Starting December 1st, we are posting a daily article corresponding to the day’s puzzle (ending December 25th). Each article shows a sample splution and explains how it works.

We want to showcase how Scala helps you write elegant solutions out-of-the-box, so we will restrict ourselves to only using the standard library.

Each day's article also includes links to alternate solutions. To add your own solution link, click "Edit this page" on a puzzle page, and then create a pull request with the link to your solution under the "Solutions from the community" section.

See you soon and happy coding!
