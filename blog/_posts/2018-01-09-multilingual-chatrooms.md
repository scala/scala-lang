title: "Introducing Non-English Chatrooms for Scala Users"
---

I attend a lot of conferences around the world, and usually all the talks and
most of the communication among attendees happens in English. It has become (if
you'll excuse the irony) the *lingua franca* of the Scala community, and the
wider software industry, even though speakers of English as a first language
are a minority.

There are, however, many users and potential users of Scala who either do not
speak English, or do not have the confidence to communicate in public forums in
English, and the expectation that English be a prerequisite to becoming an
effective Scala programmer disproportionately handicaps many minority groups
from countries outside the USA and the rest of the English-speaking world.

So I was surprised to discover that for most non-English languages, there were
no online communities where people could ask questions in their native tongue.
And so, it took very little effort to create several channels on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/) dedicated to talking about Scala in a variety of
non-English languages:

- [scala/ar](https://gitter.im/scala/ar) — Arabic
- [scala/fr](https://gitter.im/scala/fr) — French
- [scala/de](https://gitter.im/scala/de) — German
- [scala/pt](https://gitter.im/scala/pt) — Portuguese
- [scala/es](https://gitter.im/scala/es) — Spanish

So far, only this handful of channels has been created, and we encourage any
speakers of these languages to join one of these groups, but after just a few
days online, some of these channels are attracting a lot of activity. Should
demand exist for other language groups with a significant number of speakers,
we would be happy to facilitate these by creating new channels as necessary.
Please get in touch with me, [Jon Pretty](https://twitter.com/propensive/), if
you would like to suggest a new channel.

We do not anticipate English losing its primacy as the common language of the
Scala community any time soon, but we see this as an important entry-point for
non-English speakers to start their journeys with Scala, without the
distraction of having to learn a new natural language at the same time.
Lowering the barriers to entry—whether they be linguistic, social or
cultural—is important, and we want to do everything we can to make it easier
for people to feel like they are "a part of the group", and encourage more
participation!
