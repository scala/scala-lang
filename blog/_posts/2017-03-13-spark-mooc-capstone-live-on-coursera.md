title: "Spark/Scala MOOC + Capstone Project Now Live on Coursera!"
---


We're very excited to announce that our new MOOC "Big Data Analysis with Scala
and Spark" and the Scala Specialization Capstone project are now live on
Coursera!

## Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

The [Big Data Analysis with Scala and
Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data) course is 4 weeks
long, and aims to teach those coming from Scala the basics of distributed
computation using Apache Spark. It's more than whirlwhind tour of Spark's basic
APIs – this course aims to teach you fundamentally what is going on when you're
doing a distributed job, and it goes all the way from the basics of RDDs to
intermediate/advanced topics such as tweaking for data locality or writing your
own aggregation logic.

The course features three auto-graded data analysis programming assignments, all
based on real-life data sets. So we hope that makes them even more fun, because
it means you can explore the data and explore more insights beyond the questions
in the assignments!

You can sign up and participate in the course for free on Coursera (without a
certificate of completion), as part of Coursera's paid certificate program, or
as part of the Scala Specialization (a Scala minidegree) on Coursera.

Topics that Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark covers include:

- Going from Data Parallel (shared memory) to Distributed Data Parallel
- Basics of Spark's distributed collections, RDDs
- Pair RDDs, Spark's distributed key-value pairs
- Joins, Grouping, and Reduction Operations
- Shuffling, and how to avoid it!
- Relational Queries and Automatic Optimization with Spark SQL's DataFrames
- Unifying Performance and APIs with Spark SQL's Datasets

_Note this is our first time running this course material as a MOOC, so your feedback on how we can improve course is welcome! Also please be patient with us as we work out any hiccups with our new graders._

## Scala Specialization Capstone

The [Scala Specialization
Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone) is 6 weeks long. It's a
project course; so rather than following lectures week-to-week, students are
expected to exercise the concepts that they've learned through the Scala
Specialization so far on a significant project meant to be undertaken over the
full 6 weeks.

Students are challenged to implement, almost completely from scratch, a full
application aimed at processing and visualizing several gigabytes of climate
data. It covers not only data analysis, but also building ways for users to
_interactively visualize and explore_ this climate data. Students will combine
everything that they've learned so far to process data and allow users to
visualize it in their browsers, and to react to user input, using Scala.js.
