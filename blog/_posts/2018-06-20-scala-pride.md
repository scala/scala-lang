title: "Scala ❤️ Pride 2018"
---

It's that time of year! Pride 2018. In honor of all of us Scalamaris that are advocates of or identify with the LGBT community–we have a little bit of Scala love for you. I've created special Pride Scala swirls for just about every pride flag I could think of. And perhaps the best part! They're all available as t-shirts, available on [Teespring](https://teespring.com). 100% of proceeds for t-shirt sales are donated to [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/). (Go check it out!)

And don't forget, we're here for you. We love you, and you're one of us.

## There are two ways to get a shirt!

### #1: In person at Scala Days NYC (June 20-21st only)

If you are at Scala Days NYC on June 20-21st, and you would like one of the rainbow Scala swirl shirts right away, head over to scalacentershop.com to pay for a shirt, and I will hand-deliver it to you today or tomorrow (June 20th or 21st) in person at Scala Days.

### #2: Order online, shipping worldwide! Available until July 6th

**But please move quick! The shirts are only available for around two weeks, until July 6th, 2018.**

We have 11 different Scala-ized pride flags available on t-shirts. Each design is available in many different colors and styles, and come as t-shirts or tank tops.
