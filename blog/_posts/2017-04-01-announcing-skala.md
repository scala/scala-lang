# Introducing Skala: A New Vision for Dotty

We are very proud today to be able to reveal that Dotty, sometimes referred to
as "Scala 3", will now officially be known as, "Skala". And for the first time,
we are delighted to announce that Skala will be adopting German keywords and
syntax.

Designing programming languages based on English is a recurrent historical
leitmotif, but -- this April -- we felt that as Britain moves away from the
European Union, taking much of the influence of the English language with it,
now is the perfect time to make the transition to a superior language.

Just a few years ago Dotty was a mere twinkling in the eye of Martin Odersky,
but it was then that he first envisaged a successor to Scala based on German.
We met up with Prof Odersky, Skala's übermensch, at the Skala launchfest in a
Munich biergarten to find out more about this exciting development.

"I always felt that the English in Scala was a weak ersatz, and risked leaving
it in a hinterland in the long-term, so I realised then that I had to take this
decisive diktat to set Skala on the right track for a bright future. It's a
very pragmatic move; very realpolitik..." says Odersky.

The Scala community aren't neanderthals, though the transition may be harder
for some people than others, so as long as we are all finding our feet in
"Skala kindergarten", we will not be making the English keywords verboten
immediately.  And any existing Scala users concerned about feeling like
ausländers should not worry: over the coming months, the Skalazentrum
(formerly the Scala Center) will have a blitz to convert existing Scala
source code to Skala.

The Skalazentrum continues to do some very important work on
[Skalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix), supporting automatic code
rewriting between Scala and Skala. It already supports many of the Glitzy new
features first introduced in Dotty, and support for German keywords will be a
trivial addition.

## About the Changes

Martin goes on, "One aspect of Scala's keywords I always liked was that `val`,
`var` and `def` were all the same length, so identifier names would align
vertically. It just looked beautiful! We've managed to retain that property
with the new keywords, `unveränderliche`, `opportunistisch` and
`verfahrensweise`, whilst giving each of them more character, and indeed more
characters.  I'm particularly fond of `opportunistisch`, which exemplifies how
every programmer should feel about using mutable state.  And while `val` and
`var` were near-doppelgangers, `unveränderliche` and `opportunistisch` are now
much more easily disambiguated."

Some users may have angst about typing characters such as `ü` and `ß`, but
Odersky dismisses this idea: "Being completely unable to enter half the syntax
on an English keyboard may make coding slower, but that never seemed to hold
Scalaz back."

It won't be long before talk of `do`/`while` loops, `try`/`catch`/`finally`
blocks and `if`/`then`/`else` expressions, are a thing of the past, and
`mach`/`während` loops, `versuche`/`fang`/`endlich` blocks and
`sofern`/`gegebenenfalls`/`andernfalls` expressions become part of the
programming zeitgeist.

We took choosing the new German keywords as an opportunity to improve upon
their old English variants. For example, `ich` sounds much more personal than
`this`, `implementationsdefiniert` conveys the meaning of `abstract` so much
more concretely, and `erbt` saves typing a few characters over the more verbose
`extends`. Skala also introduces the new keyword, `auffaltungsanleitung` --
called `inline` in Dotty -- but now with a more explanatory name.

"Also, many people criticize the concept of implicits as masochistic. That's
why I decided to not talk about them, to keep quiet, to be `stillschweigend` in
a sense. And I'm very happy that the new keyword makes this feeling implicit."

"I have often been approached about the suitability of Scala in the enterprise.
Maybe it's just schadenfreude, but to better reflect corporate hierarchies,
`super`'s replacement keyword, `vorgesetzte`, makes it clear that the
programmer has to defer to their manager."

In this update, we also wanted to acknowledge that German is not the only
language programmers use, so we settled on replacing the `return` keyword,
which we didn't care much about anyway, with `retoure`, a French word loaned to
German.

Here is a full list of Skala keywords:

`implementationsdefiniert` | `muster` | `klasse` | `fang`
`verfahrensweise` | `mach` | `andernfalls` | `erbt`
`unrichtig` | `letzte` | `endlich` | `für`
`gegeben` | `sofern` | `stillschweigend` | `einführen`
`auffaltungsanleitung` | `faul` | `kompilationsroutine` | `vergleiche`
`erzeuge` | `nichtig` | `entität` | `überschreiben`
`paket` | `vertraulich` | `zugangsbeschränkt` | `retoure`
`versiegelt` | `vorgesetzte` | `gegebenenfalls` | `ich`
`wirf` | `charakterzug` | `wahrhaftig` | `versuche`
`sorte` | `unveränderliche` | `opportunistisch` | `außerdem`
`währen` | `vorfahrtGewähren`


## Try it out!

One of the biggest ongoing efforts of the newly-renamed Skalazentrum is the
development of the new collections library, which will form the basis for the
data structures we use on a daily basis in Skala. We have already completed
work on translating the current Strawman Collections to Skala, and to offer a
first glimpse of the improved readability of Skala code, you can [browse some
Skala source code
here](https://github.com/propensive/collection-strawman/blob/master/src/main/scala/strawman/collection/View.scala).
We are working with GitHub to support syntax highlighting for Skala, but it's
not there yet.

You can also [try out Skala for yourself
today](https://github.com/propensive/skala) with the fully-functional compiler
and REPL. Instructions on running the compiler are in the [README
file](https://github.com/propensive/skala/blob/master/README.md).

## Future Work

This is just the first step in Skala's journey, but that journey is not yet
complete.

One of Scala's great innovations was support for using method names in infix
position, and Odersky would like to take that one step further to make all
method applications postfix by default. As Mark Twain observes in his [appraisal
of German sentence structure](http://www.kombu.de/twain-2.htm), "...the writer
[appends] 'haben sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden sein,' or words to that
effect, and the monument is finished." To Odersky, postfix verbs are like "the
alpenglow of a sentence".

A problem Scala always suffered from was that it was never clear what was an
object, or "noun", and what was a method, or "verb". Soon, Skala will require
that all objects start with a capital letter, and all methods start with a
lower-case character. This will mean some changes to pattern matching, but as
Odersky says, "most people never knew the rules about capitalization of
identifiers in patterns anyway, and the backtick syntax will continue to be
available, so for me it's worth the compromise".

Another great feature of German, separable verbs, is on the cards for Skala,
too.  Odersky explains, "People often accuse German of combining multiple words
into a single word. But English can be just as clumsy: Why use just one word,
"map", to describe the method of a functor when, conceptually, you *bilde* the list
*ab*? That `ab` isn't just some insignificant particle; it changes the whole
meaning of *bilde*!" So Skala will soon be supporting this convenient syntax
for separable method names,

```
  list.bilde(_ + 1)ab
```

and remembering that `verfahrensweise` is the keyword formerly known as `def`, we
can define this new method with,

```
  verfahrensweise bilde[A](f: E => R)ab = ...
```

One more planned change to Skala's syntax is the elimination of unnecessary
spaces between modifiers and definitions. It was always a frustration to
Odersky that `abstract override lazy val` could not be a single word.  "It's a
single concept, so why not?" he asks, incredulously. Yet the reason was always
that forming compound words simply didn't work so well in English; but in
German, writing `implementationsdefiniertüberschreibenfaulunveränderliche` is
completely natural, so we intend to fully embrace it.

## Get involved!

We have come a long way in getting [Skala](https://github.com/propensive/skala)
to this stage, and there continues to be much exciting work going into the
language. With the help of organizations like the
[Skalazentrum](https://scala.epfl.ch/), [Typstufe](http://typelevel.org),
events like [Skala World](https://scala.world/) and inclusive groups like
[SkalaBridge](http://www.scalabridge.org/), we hope to grow the community
around this ambitious new language. So I hope you will join with us in
embracing this bold step towards a better zukunft.

**Editor's note: this article is dedicated to all the non-native English
speakers who use, persevere with and contribute to Scala in English. Thank you.
We are also grateful to Lars Hupel for his assistance with some of the
translations.**
