title: "Scala Days 2025 - Functional Programming And The Real World"
by: Darja Jovanovic
---
The [Scala Days Program Committee](https://scaladays.org/#committee) is proud to announce the 2025 [conference program](https://scaladays.org/schedule). It's buzzing with awesome talks, and there's something for everyone! A special thank you for their work, time, and expertise over the past couple of months ❤️

The Scala Days 2025 theme is **Functional Programming And The Real World**. The event will feature keynotes from Evan Czaplicki (creator of Elm), Martin Odersky (lead designer of Scala), and Ralf Jung (Rust core-team member), followed by four tracks across two days, bringing over fifty speakers to the stage. That is the most comprehensive tour of the Scala ecosystem yet.

Beyond the program, being a part of Scala Days means being in great company. It’s a place to reconnect with your community colleagues, exchange with Scala leaders and the Scala research team; to discover Scala companies and their products and services, individuals finding new job opportunities, and create trust relationships and lasting memories. Additionally, collocated, free events are known to complement the conference and strengthen the community bonds and spirit. Keep an eye on the upcoming announcements regarding those. Note that some of them will take place before (18th August) and after (22nd August) the conference itself. The journey to Scala Days can also be fun, see the [Scala Jam Train](https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/307435835/) going form London and Paris to Lausanne. The organising team is very inspired to, for the 12th time, bring Scala Days to life this August and welcome all the participants.

> **Quick note:**
> 1. There’s a small window to buy your tickets at the Early Bird price while the program is announced. Standard price starts on 30th May.
> 2. The program is still subject to minor adjustment, due to speaker slot movements, ongoing confirmations, and alike.

## About the program

[The Program Committee](https://scaladays.org/#committee) has crafted a two-day program across four parallel tracks—complete with keynotes and panels—each designed for a different audience. While we’ve worked hard to minimize topic overlap, we know you may still face tough choices between sessions. Don’t worry: every talk will be recorded and made available on the [Scala Days YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOHg8YCiyMVRRxb3mJT_0Mg), so you can catch up on anything you miss. Read on to set your track expectations.

**Curious about what makes Scala *Scala***? We invite you to check out Panorama track (stage 1). This track is set to showcase each corner of the Scala ecosystem - from language features, tooling innovation, discussing the future of the community and language, to creative talks and more. This is a great track for newcomers who want to gain an insight into where they can head out next, for seasoned conference-goers to get an overview of where Scala is headed, and everyone in between.

**Weighing the pros and cons of Scala for your business**? Industry track (stage 2) is for you! This track is curated to highlight the real-world case studies and best practices from companies around the world. You’ll hear straight-up stories from teams who run Scala at scale—what saved them time, where they hit snags, and the real impact on performance and ROI. Whether you're bootstrapping a startup with an aim to scale fast,  a CTO evaluating tools, an architect planning a new project, or a maintainer of a large codebase, these talks will give you the practical insight you need.

**Want to make your daily coding smoother**? Developer experience track (stage 3) offers an in-depth overview of the tooling innovation, language features and programming tips-and-tricks. Hear from your Scala peers all about the real-world techniques and insights or from tooling developers on how to help enhance your favorite tools and much more. This track is ideal for anyone who wants to get more done in less time, or for those simply curious about what's new and cool :)

**Having fun with Scala at work and beyond**? Join the Creative and Mix track (stage 4) to explore further industry case studies, tooling talks, and let yourself be surprised by all the ways Scala can be fun beside coding for work.

## Beyond the program

Complementing the conference, we begin the week with two-day hands-on workshops. Scala newcomers will have the opportunity to participate in [ScalaBridge](https://scaladays.org/blog/scalabridge-lausanne/) and we hope to announce more such events in the upcoming months, stay tuned! In the meantime, check out this fantastic community-organized **[Scala Train that runs from London and Paris to Lausanne](https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/307435835/)**. By travelling together, attendees can enjoy sustainable travel and make connections with each other before the conference begins. We hope you get inspired and organise your local community in this or another fun way!

### Workshops
Scala Days 2025 features five [workshops](https://scaladays.org/workshops), covering beginner, intermediate, and expert levels, for Scala developers to keep learning and enhance their productivity. Workshops will take place on the 18th and 19th August, between 9 AM and 4-5 PM CEST (precise time and place will be communicated closer to the date). You can already purchase your ticket, and be aware that the places are limited:

- [Functional Stream Processing](https://scaladays.org/editions/2025/workshops/functional-stream-processing) with Zainab Ali
- [Functional Programming Strategies](https://scaladays.org/editions/2025/workshops/functional-programming-strategies) with Noel Welsh

During a workshop of your choice, you will be following an experienced mentor to develop a project that will help you master a certain aspect of the language. You can use this unique opportunity to ask questions and learn from the mentors, and working in a small group is a great way to make new friends in the Scala community.
