title: "Introducing Scalafix: a migration tool for Scalac to Dotty"
---

I am excited to announce the first release of
[scalafix](http://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/), a new tool to
prepare Scala 2.x code for [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch/), a next
generation Scala compiler. This effort follows the Scala Center Advisory
Board proposal:
["Clarification of Scala to Dotty migration path"](https://scala.epfl.ch/minutes/2016/06/06/may-9-2016.html#proposal-scp-002-clarification-of-scala-to-dotty-migration-path).

There is a lot to be excited over in Dotty,
[faster compilation times](http://www.slideshare.net/Odersky/scala-days-nyc-2016),
[faster+smaller binaries](https://d-d.me/talks/scaladays2015/#/) and
[awesome error messages](http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2016/10/14/dotty-errors.html)
to name a few things. However, some Scala 2.x applications can't
immediately enjoy these benefits due to several breaking changes in
Dotty. Scalafix is part of our strategy to smoothen the migration
process for those applications.

Scalafix takes care of easy, repetitive and tedious code transformations
so you can focus on the changes that truly deserve your attention. In a
nutshell, scalafix reads a source file, transforms usage of unsupported
features into newer alternatives, and writes the final result back to
the original source file. Scalafix aims to automate the migration of as
many unsupported features as possible. There will be cases where
scalafix is unable to perform automatic migration. In such situations,
scalafix will point to the offending source line and provide
instructions on how to refactor the code. The objective is that your
Scala 2.x codebase gets up and running faster with Dotty.

What can scalafix do?
-------------------------

Scalafix comes with a command line interface and an SBT plugin. Running
scalafix is as simple as:

~~~
# CLI
scalafix Code.scala
# SBT, after adding plugin to project/plugins.sbt
sbt scalafix
~~~

More detailed instructions on how to setup scalafix are on the
[project website](http://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/).

This initial release implements two rewrites: `ProcedureSyntax` and
`VolatileLazyVal`. More rewrite rules are planned for future releases.

The `ProcedureSyntax` rewrite works like this:

~~~scala
// before
def main(args: Seq[String]) { // note lack of '='
  println("Hello scalafix!")
}
// after
def main(args: Seq[String]): Unit = { // note ': Unit ='
  println("Hello scalafix!")
}
~~~

Dropping procedure syntax is part of a general effort in Dotty to
simplify the Scala language.

The `VolatileLazyVal` rewrite adds a `@volatile` annotation to lazy vals,
like this:

~~~scala
lazy val x = ... // before
@volatile lazy val x = ... // after
~~~

With `@volatile`, Dotty uses a deadlock free scheme that is
comparable-if-not-faster than the scheme used in scalac.

How does scalafix work?
---------------------------

All the heavy-lifting behind scalafix happens in
[scala.meta](http://scalameta.org/), a new metaprogramming toolkit
aspiring to succeed scala.reflect. Scala.meta makes it easy to do
non-trivial code transformations while preserving syntactic details in
the original source file. This key attribute of scala.meta makes it
suitable for both developer tools like scalafix as well as compile-time
metaprograms like macros.

The grand vision of scala.meta is to provide a single interface to
accomplish most common metaprogramming tasks in
Scala.
![scala.meta sketch]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/img/scalameta-sketch.jpg)
 The idea is to untie metaprograms from compiler implementations, providing a
platform-independent API that works both in the Scala compiler, Dotty
and tools like IntelliJ IDEA. Metaprogram authors benefit from a
user-friendly interface built on immutable ADTs and type classes.
Compiler authors benefit from the fact that they don't need to expose
compiler internals in order to support popular features like macros.

In scalafix, we use the scala.meta API to parse Scala source files,
traverse abstract syntax trees, inspect tokens (including comments!) and
then perform the minimum required transformations to the source file.
Thanks to scala.meta dialects, which abstract away syntactic differences
between variants of Scala, we can use the same programs to manipulate
regular Scala source files, SBT files as well as code that uses new
Dotty syntax such as union types and trait parameters. All this powerful
functionality is implemented behind a minimalistic interface.
The NonVolatileLazyVal
[implementation](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalafix/rewrite/VolatileLazyVal.scala)
is 15 lines of code. It could comfortably fit in three tweets.

We would not be able to achieve this level of expressiveness with
scala.reflect, the current standard metaprogramming framework for Scala.
Why? To name a few reasons, scala.reflect does not preserve syntactic
details such as comments and scala.reflect has no notions of dialects,
so it is bound to only support Scala 2.x.

How does scalafix evolve?
-----------------------------

As we have seen above, the functionality of scalafix heavily relies on
the infrastructure provided by scala.meta. However, in order to write
more sophisticated scalafix rewrite rules, there are two main features
missing in scala.meta, namely a *scalac converter* and *semantic API*.
We are closely collaborating with Eugene Burmako, the lead developer of
scala.meta, in the development efforts of these two features.

### Scalac converter

The scalac converter is a key subsystem of scala.meta.
For every Scala feature, the converter recognizes its representation in the Scala
compiler and translates it into the corresponding data structures of the
scala.meta API.

Over the last months, we’ve made great improvements to the converter,
which is under development in the [scalameta/paradise](https://github.com/scalameta/paradise) repository.
We have established a comprehensive test suite that consists of a sample of
over 26.000 Scala source files collected from popular open-source
projects. Thanks to the joint effort of the team of scala.meta
[contributors](https://github.com/scalameta/paradise/graphs/contributors),
the converter now supports about 19.000 source files form the test
corpus. We are continuously working to increase that number, aiming to
bring language coverage to 100%.

### Semantic API

The semantic API will enable scala.meta programs to inspect compiler information
such as type inference, name resolution and other functionality that
requires a compilation step. This opens opportunities for new scalafix rewrite
rules that cannot be done on a purely syntactic level,
like `NonVolatileLazyVal` and `ProcedureSyntax`.

We already have a
[working prototype](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix/pull/14) 
of the first scalafix rewrite that uses the semantic API: `ExplicitImplicit`.
`ExplicitImplicit` inserts type annotations for implicit definitions, like this:

~~~scala
// before
implicit val x = (_: String).length
// after
implicit val x: String => Int = (_: String).length
~~~
`ExplicitImplicit` requires the semantic API in order to get the inferred type
annotations.

Towards new-style macros
----------------------------

One could say that by contributing to scala.meta, we get two features
for the price of one. First, an improved converter and semantic API
enables us to implement more sophisticated scalafix rewrite rules.
Secondly, we accelerate the development of a new macro system that will
work both with scalac and Dotty.

As announced at Scala Days 2016, the current macros based on
scala.reflect will be going away. Such macros have a number of known
issues, including over complicated API and lacking IDE support. More
importantly, the deep coupling between old-style macros and scalac
means macros written in the old system effectively cannot be
ported to Dotty. The plan is to discontinue support for scala.reflect
macros in favor of [a new macro system called
inline/meta](https://github.com/scala/scala.github.com/pull/567).

A technology preview of the new-style macros came out this summer. This
early release is still somewhat rough around the edges. Nevertheless,
[scalafmt](https://olafurpg.github.io/scalafmt/) is already using
these new macro annotations in production for more than a month now. If you
are interested in learning more, the best place to get started is 
[my recent Scala World workshop](http://olafurpg.github.io/scala.meta-workshop).

Much like scalafix, new-style macros crucially rely on the
infrastructure provided by scala.meta. Concretely, the converter and the
semantic APIs constitute a significant chunk of the implementation
effort behind the new macro system.

Interestingly, our contributions to scala.meta were originally motivated
by the needs of scalafix. However, they are also immediately helping the
development of this new universal macro system for Scala. We are excited
that our open-source collaboration with the scala.meta team brings
multiple benefits for the good of everyone!
