We call your attention to the following blog post from VirtusLab:

* https://virtuslab.com/blog/technology/scala-3-roadmap-for-2024/

It lays out the Scala 3 team's plans for Scala 3 this year.

Topics covered include the timing, contents, and compatibility stories of future Scala 3 versions. There's also specifics about plans to make improvements in build times, IDE support, and elsewhere.

**Reminder** The Scala Center also regularly publishes roadmaps.
A [previous blog post](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2024/02/06/scala-center-2024-roadmap.html) outlines the Center's 2024 plans.
