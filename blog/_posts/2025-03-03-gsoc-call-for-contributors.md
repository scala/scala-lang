---

We are thrilled to announce that the Scala Center organization has been accepted for [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!
This marks the 15th year that Scala is a part of this awesome program, empowering beginning contributors to dive into the world of Scala open source projects.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program by Google that encourages beginning contributors to participate in open source software development.
Through GSoC, contributors receive mentorship from experienced maintainers while earning a stipend for their work on open source projects during the summer.

This year, we are offering a diverse range of project ideas across the Scala ecosystem, spanning domains including web development, graphics, build tooling, GPU programming, and more.
Explore our [list of projects](https://github.com/scalacenter/GoogleSummerOfCode) to discover more exciting ideas.

We encourage new Scala programmers with a passion for open source to apply!
No matter your background, GSoC is a fantastic opportunity to gain real-world experience, learn from expert mentors, and make meaningful contributions to the Scala ecosystem.

## Call for new contributors

We are currently at the beginning of the admissions process for contributors. Until March 18th, you can:

- Browse our [list of project ideas](https://github.com/scalacenter/GoogleSummerOfCode).
- Reach out to project mentors via email to introduce yourself and discuss your interests.
- Ask questions about the project and get feedback to build a strong proposal.

The best way to engage with mentors is to send a short email, introducing yourself, your background, and your interest in the project.
Our mentors will be happy to guide you from there!

For more information, check out the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/).

Please note that GSoC is not a freelance job — it is a learning opportunity designed to give a chance to people who would otherwise not have it.
We aim to select contributors based on both their potential for growth and their project fit.

Additionally, we are excited to share that Typelevel is also participating in GSoC 2025.
Check out [Typelevel's blog post](https://typelevel.org/blog/2025/02/27/gsoc.html) for more Scala project ideas and opportunities to get involved.

We look forward to welcoming you to the Scala community and helping you embark on your open source journey!
