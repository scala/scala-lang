> **Update**: After a couple of years experimenting with Open edX, we decided
> to shut down these course instances. You can find an [up-to-date list of online courses](https://docs.scala-lang.org/online-courses.html).

We are thrilled to announce that our 4 main MOOCs are now also available
on an [Open edX instance managed at EPFL](https://courseware.epfl.ch).

[![](/resources/img/courseware-scala-moocs.png)](https://courseware.epfl.ch/)

The content of the courses remains the same as the ones on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala). The differences
are that our platform is free to use and doesnâ€™t deliver certificates (official credentials
that confirm that you successfully completed a course).

As a reminder, the courses are the following:

- Functional Programming Principles in Scala:
  An introduction to functional programming (pure functions, recursion, pattern matching, higher-order
  functions, immutable data types, type parameters, equational reasoning),
- Functional Program Design in Scala:
  A follow-up of the first course, showing how to apply the functional programming style
  to larger programs. Covers topics such as monads, lazy evaluation, property-based testing,
  futures and dataflow programming.
- Parallel Programming:
  Introduces the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism,
- Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark:
  Extends the data parallel paradigm to the distributed case (as opposed to shared-memory parallel
  or sequential collections), using Spark.

[Open edX](https://open.edx.org) is an open source learning management system that
was originally developed by the [edX](https://edx.org) nonprofit.

Our goal is to deliver the courses content in the most accessible way. We
hope you will enjoy the learning experience provided by the Open edX platform.

Happy learning!
