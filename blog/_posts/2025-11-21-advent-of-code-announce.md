## Help the elves!

For the fifth time, the Scala Center is supporting the Scala community's participation in the annual **Advent of Code** challenge for 2025. (See [Advent of Code Recap 2024](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2025/01/16/advent-of-code-recap.html) for a recap of 2024's edition).

We hope you will join us!

## What is Advent of Code?

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com), created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), is an annual event consisting of a series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles. The puzzles are released daily from December 1st through December 12th. The puzzles start easy and get harder as they go.

The goal for participants is of course pure enjoyment. But also, you can sharpen your coding skills and improve your knowledge of your programming language of choice (which is Scala, of course).

Note that the event is now 12 days long, not 25 days like previous years.

## Discord channel

We have re-opened the `#advent-of-code` [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/632150470000902164/913451015246868530) at the official [Scala Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/scala).

Here you can discuss the puzzles, share solutions, and ask for help.

The channel topic also has a link to a Scala-specific leaderboard, with a code for joining.

## Read sample solutions on our website

Our [Scala Center Advent of Code website](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2025/) is ready to go for 2025.

Once the event begins, we will post a daily article for each puzzle, a day or two after you've had a chance to solve it yourself.

Each article shows a sample solution and explains how it works. Articles are contributed by community members and vetted by the community and the Center.

We want to showcase how Scala helps you write elegant solutions out-of-the-box, so the sample solutions will only use the Scala 3 standard library.

## Share your solutions

If you would like to write one of the sample articles, you can volunteer [on this page](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-advent-of-code/discussions/842).

Each day's article also includes links to alternate solutions. To add your own solution link, click "Edit this page" on a puzzle page to make a pull request adding a link to your solution.

## Why we do this

At the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch), we love writing code in Scala, and we hope you do too. One of our core priorities is to _communicate excitement about Scala_, which motivates us to participate in the Advent of Code and share experiences solving problems with Scala with the wider programming community.

Another key priority is to improve the _onboarding experience for newcomers_. Part of that experience comes from the first impressions someone has reading Scala code. We hope that by reading the articles on [our solutions website](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/), newcomers can see that Scala is an elegant language for solving problems.

Please urge your employer to [support the Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/donate.html).

## Conclusion

We thank [@spamegg1](https://github.com/spamegg1) for co-organizing.

See you soon and happy coding!
