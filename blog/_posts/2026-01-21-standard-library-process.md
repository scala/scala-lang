# Contributing to Scala Standard Library

Starting from Scala 3.8, the Scala standard library is again available for
contributions. This however means that the main place for contributing is the
Scala 3 repository. Scala 2.13 might benefit from some improvements, but the to
get access to fully to new functionality, you need to migrate to Scala 3.

# The Process

The Scala standard library is hosted in the
[scala/scala3](https://github.com/scala/scala3) repository. Any changes that
influence the standard library API should follow [this process](https://github.com/scala/scala3/blob/main/docs/_docs/contributing/procedures/contributing-to-stdlib.md). If the changes are only internal, the process is 
the standard pull request one.

The person responsible for coordinating the process is the Scala Core Coordinator. 
Current Coordinator can be found on the [Scala Core Team page](https://www.scala-lang.org/scala-core/).
