Zinc is the incremental compiler for Scala. Most Scala developers use it daily
without noticing -- it's embedded in key build tools like [sbt][], [pants][],
[CBT][], [IntelliJ][], and [Scala IDE][].

The incremental compiler has one goal: to make your compilation times faster
without sacrificing correctness. When you change a source file, Zinc analyses
the dependencies of your code and compiles a subset of source files affected by
your change, such that the generated code is identical to the output of a clean
compile.

## Scala Center's involvement in Zinc 1.0

Zinc 1.0 has been under development for several years in a GitHub repo independent
from sbt. The Lightbend Tooling team split up Zinc to its own repo for
the purpose of providing a common incremental compiler that could benefit all
build tools, and developing it together.

A key feature of 1.0 is *class-based dependency analysis*, contributed
by [Grzegorz Kossakowski][] and commissioned by Lightbend. Class-based
dependency analysis was designed to handle Scala dependencies in a much
finer-grained scale than the previous one, pruning common cases of
overcompilation. Back then, benchmarks showed that such analysis provided
speedups of up to 40x.

However, these changes never managed to make it into a Zinc release despite
being merged on March 2016.  The project required more work before an
experimental release: a Java-friendly polished API, improvements to the
correctness of the incremental compilation, faster cold compilations, intensive
benchmarking, bugfixing, and enhanced Java support, among others.

At the [Scala Center][], we thought it was a pity that Grzegorz's work was not
in a production-ready release that Scala developers could benefit from. No one
was actively working on that Zinc to-do list and progress was slow, so we
decided to research how we could facilitate a stable 1.0 release.

That's why, in February 2017, the Center asked the Community whether we should
invest our time into the development of Zinc.  Seeing the wide participation in
this survey, with 97% in favor of it, we became convinced it was a good idea.  A
stable release would put a faster incremental compiler into everyone's hands.
That and other Scala Center efforts we embarked on would help speed up the
release of sbt 1.0.

## A preview of Zinc 1.0: an example of a 7x speedup

How big are the improvements that Zinc 1.x brings to the table and how do they
impact your day-to-day developer workflow?

To answer this question, we're going to use both Zinc 0.13.x and 1.x to compile
a big real-world project: [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org), whose core
module has **40.377** lines of Scala code without counting comments and blank
lines.

We illustrate our example with a common and relatively unintrusive operation in
every codebase: a method addition. In our case, we add a new method to a widely
dependent class like `AndHaveWord` (in `Matcher.scala`) after we've correctly
warmed up the compiler (note that it's not fully hot) and compiled the project.
How fast can Zinc 0.13.x recompile the new method?

The incremental compilation in **Zinc 0.13.x yields a compilation time of 21
seconds**.  Let's try it with Zinc 1.0.0.

[![scastie](/resources/img/blog/zinc-1.0-scalatest.gif)](/resources/img/blog/zinc-1.0-scalatest.gif)

**Zinc 1.0.0** terminates **compilation in only 3 seconds**. For this particular
example, the class-based dependency in the new version does 7x better
incremental compilation than the source-based old version.

Such experiments yield varying results depending on the Scala features
and architecture used, but the general idea is that we can expect nice speedups
in common day-to-day situations. For example, Scala projects using the cake
pattern or intensive type-level programming are likely to benefit from these
improvements.  In my experience testing and using Zinc 1.0, I have observed
speedups up to 22x.

## Contributions to Zinc 1.0

Zinc 1.0 has been a long time in the making, so it has a long track of
contributions. Following the changes previously committed by [Grzegorz
Kossakowski][] and [Eugene Yokota][], the [Scala Center][] synchronized with the
sbt team and started to work on the project.

Our contributions in the past month have been numerous and spanned several
quarters at irregular intervals.  In the following paragraphs, I provide a
high-level overview of my work.  If you're looking for the nitty-gritty
details, I suggest you [go through the list of issues and PR's labeled with
'Scala Center'](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Scala%20Center%22%20is%3Apr);
they all contain a detailed analysis and discussion of the proposed changes.

### Statistics (as of August)

* Modified lines of code: **25,136++**, **16.190--**.
* Merged commits: **214** commits.
* [Created issues](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues?utf8=✓&q=author:jvican%20is:issue): **47** in total (25 open, 22 closed).
* The Scala Center [has been involved in  the discussion of **109** issues](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues?utf8=✓&q=involves:jvican%20is:issue%20).

### Highlighted contributions

With no previous experience with Zinc, the Scala Center started to hack on the
most urgent to-do list: [the missing tasks in the class-based dependency
algorithm front](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues/174). Finalizing these tasks
was instrumental to measure how production-ready the algorithm was, and when a
Zinc 1.0 release could happen.

As new issues started to be reported and more deficiencies to show up, I worked
on other issues to stabilize the project. During this period I collaborated
with the [Pants][] team at Twitter and other users building upon Zinc. This
collaboration revolved around guaranteeing that Zinc satisfied other people's
use cases aside from [sbt][]'s, and that end users would get the best
incremental compilation experience possible.

All in all, this is a high-level summary of our contributions to Zinc 1.0:

* Improve correctness of the incremental algorithm in cases where it undercompiled.
* Fixing bugs both in the Scala bridge and the Java incremental compilation.
* Handle type-level programming more gracefully (for example, changes in type members).
* Improve old Zinc APIs and create friendly APIs to complement missing public functionality.
* Finish off the migration to Scala 2.12 and making Zinc ready for JDK8.
* Add a protobuf-based analysis file with long term binary support.
* Add features to Zinc that were missing and were considered important for Zinc's users (improvements to loggers and hooks for IDEs, for example).
* Add JMH benchmarks to reason about the performance impact of incremental compiles.
* Improve infrastructure to attract contributors:
  * Speed up CI by 7x to have a fast turnaround time,
  * Add more tests to the project,
  * Add more documentation to the APIs, a README and a CONTRIBUTING guide; and,
  * Add similar high-quality improvements to the build and scripted tests.

## External contributions

Zinc 1.0.0 also has had significant contributions from the Scala open-source
community, and I thank everyone involved to make it possible! The contributors
since our involvement in the project have been [Stu Hood][], [Peiyu Wang][],
[Krzysztof Romanowski][], [Wieslaw Popielarski][], [Peter Pan][], [Gregor
Heine][], [Łukasz Indykiewicz][], [Allan Timothy Leong][], [Guillaume
Martres][], [Wojciech Langiewicz][], [Krzysztof Borowski][], [Wojtek Pitula][],
[knirski][], [Thierry Treyer][], [Grzegorz Kossakowski][], [Dale Wijnand][] and
[Eugene Yokota][].

[Martin Duhem] and I are happy that we met some of these contributors during our
**[Scala Center sprees](https://github.com/scalacenter/sprees)** all over Europe
and that they dared to submit pull requests to Zinc; while contributing to the
project may at first sound daunting, you didn't give up and at the end your work
had a clear impact on Scala developers. Congratulations!

## A look at the new algorithm

In our previous example, we showcase the impact that the new dependency
detection algorithm has in real-world codebases. However, it may be surprising
to some users that the previous version was so slow in the first place; 21
seconds to compile a method addition seems *bad* even for a codebase of so many
lines of code and such complexity. Why was that the case?

Zinc 0.13.x has always had an underlying dependency detection operating at the
source rather than the class level. In practice, this means that the
invalidation algorithm collected more recompilation candidates than it should:
all classes defined in a source file that were "affected" by a change would be
checked for invalidation *transitively*. As it is common to define more than one
class per source file, the number of source files to recompile grew up quickly
and resulted in worse incremental compiles.

Let's show it with an example. Consider the following structure:

| Source file | Content |
| =========== | ======= |
| `A.scala`   | `class A0; class A1` |
| `B.scala`   | `class B extends A1` |
| `C.scala`   | `class C extends B`  |

In this scenario, `class B` depends on `class A1`, and `class C` depends on
`class B`. Because these dependencies are introduced by inheritance, any API
change to `class A1` will trigger the recompilation of `class B` and `class C`.
Changing `class A0` should not invalidate any source file (no source files
depend on it). However, because Zinc 0.13.x tracks dependencies at the source
file level, any API change to `class A0` triggers the recompilation of
`class B` and `class C`.

In contrast, Zinc 1.x's dependency granularity is at the class level.  With the
new detection, the incremental compiler is smart enough to understand that
nothing has to be recompiled in our previous example because it can tell apart
`class A0` from `class A1`. For that, it has a mapping of source files with
their defined classes, class names with their generated class files and class
names with their dependent class names. This information, complemented with
other mappings, allows it to be much more selective when
picking candidates for invalidation.

In general, Zinc 1.0 is faster and more correct than 0.13.x (thanks to some
fundamental improvements to the Scala bridges implementation). This high-level
explanation of the incremental compiler is in no way exhaustive; so if you'd
like to know more about the inner workings of the Scala incremental compiler,
[subscribe to the following ticket](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues/435). If
there's enough interest, I'd like to write up a technical document for future
contributors in the coming months to complement the already existing
documentation.

## Try it out!

Zinc is already available in [sbt 1.0](https://github.com/sbt/sbt), and [it will
soon be available in Pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4729). If
you're **an sbt user**, I recommend you to upgrade to latest sbt 1.0.3 and give
it a spin!

If you're a library author, add [Zinc
1.0.3](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.scala-sbt%7Czinc_2.11%7C1.0.3%7Cjar)
to your `build.sbt` with `libraryDependencies += "org.scala-sbt" % "zinc_2.11" %
"1.0.3"`. To add it to other builds tools like Maven, click
[here](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.scala-sbt%7Czinc_2.11%7C1.0.3%7Cjar).

## Special acknowledgements

I'd like to thank the sbt team, and concretely Eugene Yokota, for reviewing all
our work and always being open for improvements. I'm happy to see such cross-team
collaboration (sbt team at [Lightbend][] <-> [Scala Center][]) work in a
complex real-world project like Zinc.

Lastly, I'd like to thank Grzegorz Kossakowski for his great work and leaving so
much documentation behind, enabling others to finish off the project he started
off. I send you my best wishes to recover from [your hamstring
injury](https://twitter.com/gkossakowski/status/926339837724016640).

## Conclusion

In this announcement, I explained the work that the Scala Center has put
into the already released Zinc 1.0 and motivated it.

While happy with the results, I still believe that there's more room for
improvement, [especially when it comes to faster incremental compiles and
reproducibility](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/015-zinc-performance.md).
In the next month and a half, we will zoom in on these problems to continue
improving the productivity of Scala developers in what it's known as [SCP
15](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/015-zinc-performance.md)
(Scala Center Advisory Board Proposal).

I invite build tools to catch up with our changes and get in touch with the
Zinc team to keep improving the project. I hope that in the following weeks,
all build tools alike make Zinc 1.0 accessible to their
users.

If you'd like to ask questions about Zinc, get involved in its development or
comment on our progress,
