## State of Scala 2022 Survey

The 2022 year is slowly coming to an end, and it’s high time to share the survey’s results. This year the questions focused mainly on the status of the ecosystem, the perception of libraries, and how Scala is being used. To see the aggregated results, download this PDF:

## The Respondents

The State of Scala 2022 survey was conducted in October and attracted 2236 responses. Most of the respondents were Scala developers.
Most answers pointed to Scala 2.13 as the major version they are using. Notably, 40% of respondents said that they use Scala 3. We are happy to report that this number is even greater than we hoped for and tells us that Scala 3 adoption is growing rapidly.

## Key Takeaways

We are happy to see that almost all Scala 3 features are widely used. The only one lacking major adoption are the exports. Looking into the future, the respondents selected compile and build speed, tooling and memory usage areas as their priorities for improvement. It’s exciting to see Scala Native with 20% of the respondents voting for it - especially given its current rapid development. We feel that this survey succeeded to draw a picture of the Scala's ecosystem, we hope that the data in the survey results will prove itself useful to the Scala community.
