## State of Scala 2022 Survey

The 2022 year is slowly coming to an end, and it’s high time to share the survey’s results. This year the questions focused mainly on the status of the ecosystem, the perception of libraries, and how Scala is being used. To see the aggregated results, download this PDF:

## The Respondents

The State of Scala 2022 survey was conducted in October and attracted 2236 responses. Most of the respondents were Scala developers.
Most answers pointed to Scala 2.13 as the major version they are using. Notably, 40% of respondents said that they use Scala 3. We are happy to report that this number is even greater than we hoped for and tells us that Scala 3 adoption is growing rapidly. The respondents mostly use Scala for web applications, data processing, and writing libraries and frameworks. They work primarily in projects with 10k to 100k lines  (40.8%) of code and corporations with 101 to 1000 employees (33.2%). Most respondents are based in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland.

## Key Takeaways

We are happy to see that almost all Scala 3 features are widely used. The only one lacking major adoption are the exports. Looking into the future, the respondents selected compile and build speed, tooling and memory usage areas as their priorities for improvement. It’s exciting to see Scala Native with 20% of the respondents voting for it - especially given its current rapid development. We feel that this survey succeeded to draw a picture of the Scala's ecosystem, we hope that the data in the survey results will prove itself useful to the Scala community.

## How Scala is used
The most popular Scala paradigm is immutability. Over 95% of respondents pointed out that they use immutable vals, collections, and data structures often (>= 4). The purely functional approach using dedicated libraries was selected as used quite often (>= 3) by almost 80% of respondents. For the same threshold, respondents selected the object-oriented approach 65.5% of the time. Mutable vars, collections, and data structures were reported to be used rarely, with over 80% of the responses being two or lower. 
The most widely used new Scala 3 features are the enums, extension methods, and top-level definitions. Union types and opaque type aliases were reported to be employed less frequently, but most respondents still use them quite often. Exports are the only new feature that appears to be lacking significant adoption.
