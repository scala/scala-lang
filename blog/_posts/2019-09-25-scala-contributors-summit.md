As the 3rd Contributors Summit approaches at [ScalaSphere.it](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/scala-contributors-summit-a-free-event-as-part-of-sphereit-2019-tickets-70786465223?_eboga=641332631.1559206884) in Kraków, Poland on the 8th of October, thanks to Scala Center and VirtusLab collaboration,
we figured it is high time to gather our notes and write a proper blog on this topic.

## What is the Scala Contributors Summit?

Scala Contributors Summit is an event that brings together active contributors, library authors, maintainers, and Scala User Group/Conference organisers for a day-long in-person event to discuss and exchange their experiences about all things Scala.

The goal of the event is to identify the pain points that prevent the Scala ecosystem from growing in a sustainable way, and to propose solutions to them.
What is expected from participants?

Participants are not expected to prepare anything before the event. They are only expected to contribute their thoughts and opinions in the discussions. The facilitators will be responsible for writing notes and summarizing the discussions after the end of the day.

## Concept

*The idea is simple:* let’s bring people together to discuss common issues in person. Not only that in-person discussions are more efficient, less time consuming, and more impactful but they allow the opportunity of developing personal relationships, building empathy and trust, that online communication cannot provide. And let’s face it - it’s fun to spend time with peers, speaking about things we love doing (o:

*Ideal time & place:* colocating the Summit with a big conference that attracts many contributors is a natural fit, and so the first Contributors Summit took place a day after ScalaDays 2018 closed at Zalando offices in Berlin, initiated by Heather Miller, the Scala Center director at the time.

*We recognise:* most of Scala contributors are investing their free time and resources to develop a better OS ecosystem, therefore, as a small token, we find sponsors to support this event to be opened & free for the participants on the day.

## Brief history

### Scala Days Berlin, 18th May 2018, all day, hosted and sponsored by Zalando

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scala contributors summit was great! Big kudos for <a href="https://twitter.com/heathercmiller?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@heathercmiller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scalacenter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#scalacenter</a><br>I am wating for next edition and results of many amazing discussions. <br>One great exmple: build tools components boudaries proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ebenwert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ebenwert</a> <a href="https://t.co/kKrsctwnnq">pic.twitter.com/kKrsctwnnq</a></p>&mdash; Krzysztof Romanowski (@RomanowskiKr) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomanowskiKr/status/997781516766806016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Around 50 Scala library contributors, authors, and maintainers gathered and discussed various topics, such as the upcoming changes in Scala 3, improvements to the documentation and the website, the future of Scala tooling for both OSS developers and big companies, proposals to better collaborate online and welcome more contributors, etc. Participants shared with us that they learned a lot from each other, how helpful it was to be present in person and meet many of their colleagues, and exchange experience.

No specific program was proposed. Instead, topics and groups were formed on the spot: anyone could propose a topic and interested participants would join for discussion.

Significant result: Scala Improvement Process took place during the Contributors Summit, and public was for the first time present during the meeting in person. In this particular meeting the SIP committee agreed on approaching Scala 3 changes, dividing worklad in batches as well as giving a month per batch to collect community's input. For more on this, please read the SIP minutes](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/minutes/2018-05-18-sip-minutes.html).

Otherwise in this edition, even though some were taking notes, not all were collected, therefore will not be published here. (If you have notes, please share them with us scala.center@epfl.ch)

### Scala Days EPFL Lausanne, 10th June 2019, all day, sponsored by VirtusLab

Great feedback from the Berlin edition, we decided to keep the tradition and organised it a day before, kick-starting the 10th Anniversary of the Scala Days conference in Lausanne, June 2019.
This time, there were over 60 participants that were discussing, amongst other:
