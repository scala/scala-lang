Popular ways to connect with the Scala community include forums, chat rooms, local user groups, and conferences.

The community is also the source of many libraries, tools, and other resources around Scala.

## Who's behind Scala?

Scala was created by
[Prof. Martin Odersky](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch).

The Scala language and associated websites are cooperative projects of
the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch),
the Scala 3 team in Martin's research group (also at EPFL),
the Scala teams at [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com) and
[VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com), and the Scala community more
broadly, with participation from many companies, organizations, and
individuals.

Scala 2 maintenance is primarily handled by the Lightbend team.
They also participate in Scala 3 development.

VirtusLab focuses on infrastructure and tooling for Scala 3.

The Scala Center focuses on education (especially online courses),
documentation, open source community outreach, and tooling.  Community
participation in all of these efforts is strongly encouraged.

## Forums

The Scala Center operates the following Discourse forums:

 * **[users.scala-lang.org](https://users.scala-lang.org)**: The main forum for questions, discussions, and announcements about programming in Scala. Beginner questions are very welcome. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.  (Replaces the old scala-user and scala-announce groups.)

 * **[contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org)**: For anything related to moving Scala forward; from Scala Platform library discussions, to Scala Improvement Process discussions, to development work on the Scala compiler, standard library, and modules. Core maintainers and open-source contributors are both welcome, as well as those who want to see whatâ€™s coming down the pipe and would like to be involved.  (Replaces the old scala-internals, scala-language, scala-debate, scala-sips, and scala-tools groups.)

 * **[teachers.scala-lang](https://teachers.scala-lang.org)**: Discussions related to the usage of Scala to teach programming: material, tooling, guidelines.

Discourse is an open-source forum and mailing list platform. You can participate via the web, or you can use "mailing list mode", where you receive posts in your inbox and can reply to them via email. The web interface provides statistics, upvoting, polls, and other features. Posts can be written in Markdown, including syntax highlighting.

These forums are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

Lightbend operates a Discourse forum as well:

 * **[discuss.lightbend.com](https://discuss.lightbend.com)**: For discussion of reactive architectures, Akka, Play, and related tooling including sbt.

## Scala Jobs

Employers and job seekers can find each other in the #jobs channel of the [Scala Discord](https://discord.gg/scala).

Job postings are not allowed in our other forums and chat rooms.

## Chat Rooms

Our main chat platform is Discord, and the main Scala server is:

* **[Scala](https://discord.com/invite/scala)**
  * the #scala-users channel is especially beginner-friendly
  * the #scala-contributors channel is about moving Scala forward
  * the #jobs channel is the only place we allow job postings
  * ask on #admin if you have questions or suggestions about the server itself
  * there are many other channels, including #spark, #scala-js, and #scala-native

The server is covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

Alternate clients such as [Element](https://element.io) are supported
via a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) bridge.  Connect to
`#scala-lang:matrix.org` to access the main Discord channel, or explore `#scala-space:matrix.org` to see channels from all over the Scala community (many are bridged in from other places like Discord, Gitter, or IRC).

Scala-oriented Discord servers operated by the community include:

* **[IntelliJ](https://discord.gg/aUKpZzeHCK)**: the IntelliJ IDEA development environment
* **[Scalameta](https://discord.gg/RFpSVth)**: Scalameta-based tooling: Metals, Scalameta, Scalafix, Scalafmt, and Mdoc
* **[Play Framework](https://discord.gg/g5s2vtZ4Fa)**: the Play web framework for Scala and Java
* **[Typelevel](https://discord.gg/XF3CXcMzqD)**: the Typelevel ecosystem for pure-functional programming in Scala

* **[scala/scala](https://gitter.im/scala/scala)** (Gitter)
* **[#scala](https://libera.chat)** (IRC)

International chat rooms are available as well:

* **[scala_ru](https://t.me/scala_ru)** (Telegram)
* **[Scala Ukraine](https://t.me/scala_ukraine)** (Telegram)

Note also that Stack Overflow offers languages other than English, for
example [the scala tag on es.stackoverflow.com](https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala).

## Reporting issues

If you're having a problem with Scala, your first line of defense is
our forums and chat rooms. The unexpected behavior you're seeing might
not be a bug. Especially if you're new to the language, it's best to
discuss the matter with more experienced users before filing a bug
report.

That said, bugs do occur and bug reports are valuable. You can report
bugs here:

Scala 2 compiler, standard library, and language spec:

* [scala/bug](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues)

Scala 3 compiler and standard library additions:

* [lampepfl/dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues)

Don't forget to search past issues first to see if the issue has
already been reported.

## User Groups

Most local Scala user groups are listed on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/scala/).

## Conferences

## Scala open source

Want to start making open-source contributions to projects in the
Scala ecosystem?

Scaladex lists [projects welcoming contributions](https://index.scala-lang.org/search?q=&contributingSearch=true).

Also, on GitHub, a common convention is to use the label "good first issue"
on issues that are especially easy on-ramps to getting started in
a particular repo:

* "good first issue" tickets: [GitHub link](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+language%3AScala+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)

And, some repos also use a "help wanted" label if the maintainers
especially desire contributor attention:

* "help wanted" tickets: [GitHub link](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+language%3AScala+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)

## Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award

The [Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award](./phil-bagwell-award.html) is given to individuals who have made significant efforts to grow the Scala Community.

## Archives

Read-only archives of these retired groups remain available.
