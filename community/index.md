Popular ways to connect with the Scala community include mailing lists, chat rooms, user groups, and conferences.

The community is also the source of many libraries, tools, and other resources around Scala.


## Mailing Lists

The Scala mailing lists are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

This is our most beginner-friendly list:

 * **[Scala-User](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-user)**: the main forum for questions and discussions, including beginner questions, about programming in Scala. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.

This list is low-traffic and all posts are moderated:

 * **[Scala-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce)**: announcements of new Scala releases, tools, libraries, and other resources.

Other, more specialized lists:

 * **[Scala-Language](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language)**: discussions about the Scala language itself. Why Scala is the way it is, and how it could be different.
 * **[Scala-Debate](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-debate)**: the "any topic goes" list. While professional courtesy and respect must be maintained, discussion and speculation on controversial topics and “what-if” type questions can occur. Threads sometimes migrate here from other lists if they become too specialized, lengthy, or contentious.
 * **[Scala-Tools](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-tools)**: specifically for tooling around Scala, such as editors and build tools.
 * **[Scala-SIPs](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips)**: interest group devoted to Scala Improvement Process (SIP) and Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) proposals.  If you want to see what’s coming down the pipe and you’d like to be involved, this is the mailing list for you.

And most specialized of all:

 * **[Scala-Internals](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals)**: for discussing development work on the Scala compiler and standard library. Core maintainers and active open-source contributors are both welcome. (If you're not sure if your thread belongs here, ask a contributor, or try another list first.)

### No Job Postings

Job listings are not allowed on the mailing lists.  While we're all very glad to see more and more Scala jobs, please confine these listings to more appropriate forums.

### Older archives

The following "Archive at Gmane" links include messages predating the migration to Google Groups: [scala-user](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user), [scala-announce](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.announce), [scala-language](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala), [scala-debate](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.debate), [scala-tools](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.tools), [scala-internals](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.internals).

## Chat Rooms

The main [Gitter](https://gitter.im) room for Scala is:

* **[scala/scala](https://gitter.im/scala/scala)**: like the scala-user mailing list. Questions, general discussion, etc.

Other, more specialized rooms include:

* **[spark-scala/Lobby](https://gitter.im/spark-scala/Lobby)**: for discussions and questions about using Scala for Spark programming

There are many other rooms devoted to individual Scala libraries and technologies.

Rooms about the future of Scala:

* **[scala/contributors](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors)**: like the scala-internals mailing list. For Scala contributors to discuss language internals.
* **[scala/slip](https://gitter.im/scala/slip)**: for discussion of SLIPs and SIPs (Scala Library and Scala Improvement Process) proposals

IRC users can chat about Scala anytime on the [Scala IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=scala&prompt=1): `irc://irc.freenode.net/scala`

## User Groups

Find your local Scala user group on [Scala Space](http://scala.space/) or on Meetup's [Scala meetup list](http://scala.meetup.com/).

## Conferences

See our [events page](/events/).

## Stack Overflow

Scala is an active [topic on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala), a very popular programmer Q&A site.

## Reddit

There is a large and active Scala community on the [/r/Scala](http://reddit.com/r/scala) subreddit.

## Sources of Scala News

## Community Libraries and Tools

Finding libraries:

* [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org), maintained by the Scala Center, is "an index of the known Scala ecosystem"
* [Awesome Scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala) is "a community driven list of useful Scala libraries, frameworks and software"
* [Tools and Libraries](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tools+and+Libraries), a page on the (now mostly retired) Scala wiki, also lists and categorizes Scala libraries
* [Typelevel.org](http://typelevel.org) provides an assortment of popular libraries and extensions to Scala.
* [Trending Scala repositories](https://github.com/trending?l=scala&since=monthly) on GitHub

Staying current:

* [implicit.ly](http://implicit.ly) announces new versions of Scala libraries as they become available
* [Scala-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce) also has release announcements

## Non-JVM platforms

* [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org) compiles Scala code to JavaScript
* [Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org) compiles Scala code to LLVM for native execution
* [Scala on Android](http://scala-android.org) community site

## Dotty

* [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch) is a next generation compiler for Scala, under development at EPFL
