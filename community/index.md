Popular ways to connect with the Scala community include forums, chat rooms, local user groups, and conferences.

The community is also the source of many libraries, tools, and other resources around Scala.

## Who's behind Scala?

The Scala language and associated websites are cooperative projects of
the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch),
[Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com), and the Scala community
more broadly, with participation from many companies, organizations,
and individuals.

The Scala team at Lightbend concentrates on advancing the language,
compiler, and standard library.  The Scala Center focuses on education
(especially online courses), documentation, open source community
outreach, and tooling.  Community participation in all of these
efforts is strongly encouraged.

Scala was created by
[Prof. Martin Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/).  Martin and
his research group at EPFL remain heavily involved with the language,
including developing [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch), a
next-generation compiler for Scala.

## Forums / Mailing Lists

The Scala Center operates two Discourse forums:

 * **[users.scala-lang.org](https://users.scala-lang.org)**: The main forum for questions, discussions, and announcements about programming in Scala. Beginner questions are very welcome. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.  (Replaces the old scala-user and scala-announce groups.)

 * **[contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org)**: For anything related to moving Scala forward; from Scala Platform library discussions, to Scala Improvement Process discussions, to development work on the Scala compiler, standard library, and modules. Core maintainers and open-source contributors are both welcome, as well as those who want to see whatâ€™s coming down the pipe and would like to be involved.  (Replaces the old scala-internals, scala-language, scala-debate, scala-sips, and scala-tools groups.)

Discourse is an open-source forum and mailing list platform. You can participate via the web, or you can use "mailing list mode", where you receive posts in your inbox and can reply to them via email. The web interface provides statistics, upvoting, polls, and other features. Posts can be written in Markdown, including syntax highlighting.

These forums are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

Lightbend operates a Discourse forum as well:

 * **[discuss.lightbend.com](https://discuss.lightbend.com)**: For discussion of reactive architectures, Akka, Play, Lagom, and related tooling including sbt.

## Scala Jobs

Employers and job seekers can find each other in the [scala/job-board Gitter room](https://gitter.im/scala/job-board).

Job listings are not allowed in our other forums and chat rooms.

## Chat Rooms

Our main chat platform is [Gitter](https://gitter.im).  See next section for other platforms.

The main Gitter room for Scala is:

* **[scala/scala](https://gitter.im/scala/scala)**: Questions, general discussion, etc. Beginner-friendly.

Other, more specialized rooms include:

* **[scala/center](https://gitter.im/scala/center)**: for discussions about Scala community governance, processes, the Scala Platform, and projects going on at the Scala Center.
* **[scala/contributors](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors)**: for contributors to discuss work on changes to Scala.
* **[scala/moocs](https://gitter.im/scala/moocs)**: for talking about the Scala Center's online courses
* **[scala/job-board](https://gitter.im/scala/job-board)**: for employers and job seekers to connect with each other
* **[scala-native/scala-native](https://gitter.im/scala-native/scala-native)**: for discussion about the Scala to LLVM compiler.
* **[scala-js/scala-js](https://gitter.im/scala-js/scala-js)**: for discussion about the Scala to JavaScript compiler.
* **[lampepfl/dotty](https://gitter.im/lampepfl/dotty)**: for discussion about the next generation Scala compiler.

International rooms are available as well:

* **[scala/scala-india](https://gitter.im/scala/scala-india)**
* **[scala/ar](https://gitter.im/scala/ar)**
* **[scala/cn](https://gitter.im/scala/cn)**

* **[scala_en](https://t.me/scala_en)** (Telegram)

All of the rooms above are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

There are many other rooms devoted to individual Scala libraries and technologies.
Examples include:

* **[spark-scala/Lobby](https://gitter.im/spark-scala/Lobby)**: for discussions and questions about using Scala for Spark programming
* **[typelevel/cats](https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats)**: for discussion about the Cats library of abstractions for functional programming and FP in general.

## Chat Rooms (Discord, IRC)

Discord users can chat about Scala [via this link](https://discord.gg/scala).

IRC users can chat about Scala on the [Scala IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=scala&prompt=1) on Freenode: `irc://irc.freenode.net/scala`

As with Gitter, the Discord and IRC channels are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html). Moderation is handled by community volunteers and by representatives of the Scala Center.
