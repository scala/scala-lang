Popular ways to connect with the Scala community include forums, chat rooms, local user groups, and conferences.

The community is also the source of many libraries, tools, and other resources around Scala.

## Who's behind Scala?

The Scala language and associated websites are cooperative projects of
the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch),
[Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com), and the Scala community
more broadly, with participation from many companies, organizations,
and individuals.

The Scala team at Lightbend concentrates on advancing the language,
compiler, and standard library.  The Scala Center focuses on education
(especially online courses), documentation, open source community
outreach, and tooling.  Community participation in all of these
efforts is strongly encouraged.

Scala was created by
[Prof. Martin Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/).  Martin and
his research group at EPFL remain heavily involved with the language,
including developing [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch), a
next-generation research compiler for Scala.

## Forums and Mailing Lists

For discussions around Scala, we are in the process of migrating from
Google Groups to Discourse.

For now, these Google Groups remain active:

 * **[scala-user](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-user)**: The main forum for questions and discussions, including beginner questions, about programming in Scala. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.
 * **[scala-announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce)**: Announcements of new Scala releases, tools, libraries, and other resources.

Other discussions are now on Discourse, here:

 * **[contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org)**: For anything related to moving Scala forward; from Scala Platform library discussions, to Scala Improvement Process discussions, to development work on the Scala compiler, standard library, and modules. Core maintainers and open-source contributors are both welcome, as well as those who want to see what’s coming down the pipe and would like to be involved.  (Replaces the old scala-internals, scala-language, scala-debate, scala-sips, and scala-tools groups.)

Discourse is an open-source forum and mailing list platform. You can participate via the web, or you can use "mailing list mode", where you receive posts in your inbox and can reply to them via email. The web interface provides statistics, upvoting, polls, and other features. Posts can be written in Markdown, including syntax highlighting.

All of these forums and lists are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

### No Job Postings

Job listings are not allowed on the forums and other channels.  While we're all very glad to see more and more Scala jobs, please confine these listings to more appropriate venues.

## Chat Rooms

The main [Gitter](https://gitter.im) room for Scala is:

* **[scala/scala](https://gitter.im/scala/scala)**: like the scala-user mailing list. Questions, general discussion, etc. Beginner-friendly!

Other, more specialized rooms include:

* **[scala/center](scala/center)**: for discussions about Scala community governance, processes, the Scala Platform, and general updates about projects and things going on at the Scala Center.
* **[scala/contributors](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors)**: for contributors to discuss work on changes to Scala.
* **[spark-scala/Lobby](https://gitter.im/spark-scala/Lobby)**: for discussions and questions about using Scala for Spark programming

These rooms are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

There are many other rooms devoted to individual Scala libraries and technologies.

IRC users can chat about Scala anytime on the [Scala IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=scala&prompt=1): `irc://irc.freenode.net/scala`

## User Groups

Find your local Scala user group on [Scala Space](http://scala.space/) or on Meetup's [Scala meetup list](http://scala.meetup.com/).

## Conferences

See our [events page](/events/).

## Stack Overflow

Scala is an active [topic on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala), a very popular programmer Q&A site.

## Reddit

There is a large and active Scala community on the [/r/Scala](http://reddit.com/r/scala) subreddit.

## Sources of Scala News

## Community Libraries and Tools

Finding libraries:

* [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org), maintained by the Scala Center, is "an index of the known Scala ecosystem"
* [Awesome Scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala) is "a community driven list of useful Scala libraries, frameworks and software"
* [Tools and Libraries](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tools+and+Libraries), a page on the (now mostly retired) Scala wiki, also lists and categorizes Scala libraries
* [Typelevel.org](http://typelevel.org) provides an assortment of popular libraries and extensions to Scala.
* [Trending Scala repositories](https://github.com/trending?l=scala&since=monthly) on GitHub

Staying current:

* [implicit.ly](http://implicit.ly) announces new versions of Scala libraries as they become available
* [Scala-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce) also has release announcements

## Non-JVM platforms

* [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org) compiles Scala code to JavaScript
* [Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org) compiles Scala code to LLVM for native execution
* [Scala on Android](http://scala-android.org) community site

## Dotty

* [Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch) is a next generation compiler for Scala, under development at EPFL
    * [Dotty FAQ](http://dotty.epfl.ch/#why-dotty)

## The Scala Center

* [The Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) is an open source foundation that brings together a coalition of individuals and organizations working together to contribute to Scala.

## Mailing Lists (Retired)

These lists are being retired; please use [contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org) instead.

 * **[Scala-Language (retired)](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language)**: discussions about the Scala language itself. Why Scala is the way it is, and how it could be different.
 * **[Scala-Debate (retired)](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-debate)**: the "any topic goes" list. While professional courtesy and respect must be maintained, discussion and speculation on controversial topics and “what-if” type questions can occur. Threads sometimes migrate here from other lists if they become too specialized, lengthy, or contentious.
 * **[Scala-Tools (retired)](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-tools)**: specifically for tooling around Scala, such as editors and build tools.
 * **[Scala-SIPs (retired)](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips)**: interest group devoted to Scala Improvement Process (SIP) and Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) proposals.  If you want to see what’s coming down the pipe and you’d like to be involved, this is the mailing list for you.
 * **[Scala-Internals (retired)](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals)**: for discussing development work on the Scala compiler and standard library. Core maintainers and active open-source contributors are both welcome. (If you're not sure if your thread belongs here, ask a contributor, or try another list first.)
