Naturally, the best way to get to know the community is to listen and start talking to them. -->

Developers in countries all over the world are using Scala for a large variety of applications across a broad range of industries. Popular ways to connect with the Scala community are via mailing lists or IRC channels, listed below.

Though there are plenty of opportunities to connect face-to-face with others in the community-- for example, via local [Scala Meetups](http://scala.meetup.com/), or local [Scala user groups](http://www.scala-tribes.org).


## Mailing Lists

Scala has the following primary mailing lists. For those lists that existed before they were migrated to Google Groups, see the links for complete archives on Gmane.

 * **[Scala-User](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-user)**: the main forum for questions and discussions about the Scala programming ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user)). In particular, newbie questions and programming experiences and questions should go to this list.
 * **[Scala-Language](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language)**: the main forum for discussions and news about the Scala language ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala)).
 * **[Scala-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce)**: announcements of new Scala releases, packages and
 applications ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.announce)).
 * **[Scala-Debate](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-debate)**: a more relaxed list for questions and discussions
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.debate)). In particular, the following should go to this list:
    * questions and suggestions around the future of Scala.
    * trails of discussions that started in scala but become too specialized to be of interest to most readers.
    * topics where you suspect that only a few people would be interested.
 * **[Scala-Tools](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-tools)**: the main forum for discussions about the Scala tools
 contributed by the community ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.tools)).
 * **[Scala-Internals](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals)**: discussions about the core internal design and implementation of the Scala system. This list is mainly used by developers who commit code to the Scala code base, but it is open to the general public in the interest of transparency. Please only post new threads if you commit to the Scala code base, and you need to discuss the internals of the Scala system. Bug reports, feature requests, and general discussions should go to the other lists instead
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.internals)).
 * **[Scala-XML](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-xml)**: interest group devoted to the Scala XML infrastructure
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.xml)).
 * **[Scala-SIPs](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips)**: interest group devoted to the Scala Improvement Process (SIP) proposals.
