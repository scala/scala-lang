Popular ways to connect with the Scala community include forums, chat rooms,
local user groups, and conferences.

The community is also the source of many libraries, tools, and other resources
around Scala.

## Forums

The Scala Center operates the following Discourse forums:

- **[users.scala-lang.org](https://users.scala-lang.org)**: The main forum for
  questions, discussions, and announcements about programming in Scala. Beginner
  questions are very welcome. Any question can and should receive a courteous
  and insightful answer. (Replaces the old scala-user and scala-announce
  groups.)

- **[contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org)**: For
  anything related to moving Scala forward; from Scala Platform library
  discussions, to Scala Improvement Process discussions, to development work on
  the Scala compiler, standard library, and modules. Core maintainers and
  open-source contributors are both welcome, as well as those who want to see
  what’s coming down the pipe and would like to be involved. (Replaces the old
  scala-internals, scala-language, scala-debate, scala-sips, and scala-tools
  groups.)

- **[teachers.scala-lang](https://teachers.scala-lang.org)**: Discussions
  related to the usage of Scala to teach programming: material, tooling,
  guidelines.

Discourse is an open-source forum and mailing list platform. You can participate
via the web, or you can use "mailing list mode", where you receive posts in your
inbox and can reply to them via email. The web interface provides statistics,
upvoting, polls, and other features. Posts can be written in Markdown, including
syntax highlighting.

These forums are covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

Akka operates a Discourse forum as well:

- **[discuss.akka.io](https://discuss.akka.io)**: For discussion of
  the Akka libraries, Akka SDK, and reactive architectures.

## Chat rooms

Our main chat platform is Discord, and the main Scala server is:

- **[Scala](https://discord.com/invite/scala)**
    - the #scala-users channel is especially beginner-friendly
    - the #scala-contributors channel is about moving Scala forward
    - the #jobs channel is the only place we allow job postings
    - ask on #admin if you have questions or suggestions about the server itself
    - there are many other channels, including #spark, #scala-js, and #scala-native

The server is covered by the [Scala Code of Conduct](../conduct.html).

Alternate clients such as [Element](https://element.io) are supported via a
[Matrix](https://matrix.org) bridge. Connect to `#scala-lang:matrix.org` to
access the main Discord channel, or explore `#scala-space:matrix.org` to see
channels from all over the Scala community (many are bridged in from other
places like Discord, Gitter, or IRC).

brings together a coalition of individuals and organizations working together
to contribute to Scala. See the [Center's FAQ](https://scala.epfl.ch/faqs.html).

## Ambassadors

Ambassadors are key figures in the Scala community: speakers, organizers,
teachers, content creators, open source maintainers, and so on. They are often
present at community events, or open to answering questions.

There are too many other Scala learning resources out there for any
list to be exhaustive, but here are a few:

- [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org)
- [Scala Cookbook](https://scalacookbook.com)

## Libraries and tools

Integrated Development Environments:

* [Scala IDEs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/scala-ides.html) discusses main Scala IDEs

Finding libraries:

- [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org), maintained by the Scala Center, is
  "an index of the known Scala ecosystem"
- [Awesome Scala](https://index.scala-lang.org/awesome) is "a community driven
  list of useful Scala libraries, frameworks and software"
- [Typelevel.org](https://typelevel.org) provides an assortment of popular
  libraries and extensions to Scala.

## Security

To receive security announcements or contact us about security issues, see our
[security policy](/security/).

## Reporting issues

If you're having a problem with Scala, your first line of defense is our forums
and chat rooms. The unexpected behavior you're seeing might not be a bug.
Especially if you're new to the language, it's best to discuss the matter with
more experienced users before filing a bug report.

That said, bugs do occur and bug reports are valuable. You can report bugs here:

Scala 2 compiler, standard library, and language spec:

- [scala/bug](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues)

Scala 3 compiler and standard library additions:

- [scala/scala3](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues)

Don't forget to search past issues first to see if the issue has already been
reported.

## Scala open source

Want to start making open-source contributions to projects in the Scala
ecosystem?

Scaladex lists
[projects welcoming contributions](https://index.scala-lang.org/search?q=&contributingSearch=true).

Also, on GitHub, a common convention is to use the label "good first issue" on
issues that are especially easy on-ramps to getting started in a particular
repo:

- "good first issue" tickets:
  [GitHub link](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+language%3AScala+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)

And, some repos also use a "help wanted" label if the maintainers especially
desire contributor attention:

- "help wanted" tickets:
  [GitHub link](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+language%3AScala+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)

## Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award

The [Phil Bagwell Memorial Scala Community Award](./phil-bagwell-award.html) is
given to individuals who have made significant efforts to grow the Scala
Community.
