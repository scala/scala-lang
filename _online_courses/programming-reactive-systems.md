This seven-week course teaches “reactive programming” techniques
for building scalable, resilient and responsive systems. You'll
learn how to:

- design systems resilient to failures,
- implement systems that scale out according to varying workloads,
- use, transform and sequence asynchronous computations using `Future` values,
- write concurrent systems based on [Akka](https://akka.io) actors,
- define well-typed communication protocols using **Akka Typed**,
- process large streams of data with limited resources using **Akka Streams**,
- understand how back-pressure controls flows of data.
